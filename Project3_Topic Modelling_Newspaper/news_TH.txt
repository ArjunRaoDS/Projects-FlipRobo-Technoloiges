NIA conducts simultaneous raids in Kerala, West Bengal; says Pakistan-sponsored module busted

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
NEW DELHI

Nine “al-Qaeda terrorists”
were arrested in simultane-
ous raids at several locations
in Ernakulam, Kerala, and
Murshidabad in West Bengal
on Saturday, the National In-
vestigation Agency (NIA)
said.

The accused were asso-
ciated with a “Pakistan-spon-
sored module of the Al-Qae-
da”, the agency said.

Murshid Hasan, Iyakub
Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen
were picked up from Ernaku-
lam, while Najmus Sakib,
Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal,
Leu Yean Ahmed, Al Mamun
Kamal and Atitur Rehman

group was planning to un-

vital installations with an
aim to kill innocent people

statement.

A large quantity of incrim-

“As per preliminary inves-
tigation, these individuals
were radicalised by Pakistan-
based al-Qaeda terrorists on
social media and were motiv-
ated to undertake attacks at
multiple places, including
the National Capital Region.
For this purpose, the module
was actively indulging in
fund raising and a few mem-

to travel to New Delhi to pro-

Produced before courts
The accused were produced
before the courts concerned
in Kerala and West Bengal for
custody and further investi-
gation, the NIA added.

The raids in Ernakulam
were conducted ina joint op-

Punjab Chief Minister Ama-

Dal of misleading people on
the contentious agriculture

withdraw from the National

such a critical issue and in-
stead come out in the open to
fight against the NDA by with-
drawing from the alliance,”
said the Chief Minister, ad-

All political parties have un-

short the monsoon session of
Parliament that was sche-

an emergency business advi-

called by Lok Sabha Speaker
Om Birla, owing to the rising
number of COVID-19 cases.

community. Thanamir was
primarily known as the last
stop for trekkers to Saramati,
Nagaland’s highest peak at
3,840 m above sea level,
until the State government
declared it a vegetable
village in 2013, almost five
years after it was connected

by a road. But the Kashmir-
origin apples grown
organically added gloss to
the village after the
Thanamir Students’ Union
(TSU) began organising a
festival to attract officials,
horticulture experts and
adventurous visitors.

“We could not organise
the annual Apple Festival
this year after eight editions
due to the COVID-19
restrictions. This made us
work on a project to market
our apples to the nearest
urban centres in an
organised way,” TSU vice-
president N. Lemchimong
told The Hindu.

High on demand

This meant delivering the
apples to Kohima, more than
300 km away, and Dimapur
further beyond in August-
September. At a wholesale
price of 21,000 a carton of 7
kg each, the apples sold out
inno time.

Vatsu Meru, a former
Minister, said the Thanamir
apples had been high on
demand but difficult to get

earlier. It needed an
initiative like the TSU’s for
urban consumers to get
them nearer home.

“The apples are quite
large, sweet and juicy,” said
homemaker Adeno Koutsu.

Thanamir’s Head Gaon
Bura (village elder)
Rethrongki said more than
150 apple farmers had a
better harvest this year
compared to 2019.
Offloading the apples would
have been difficult without
the help of TSU because of
periodic lockdowns, he said.

“Our project to market
the apples is for three years.
We are also looking at
coordinating with students
of other apple-producing
villages for marketing fruits
on a larger scale,” Mr.
Lemchimong said.

Uttar Pradesh, which no other
party is talking about. “Several

Failures in the past

Since 2017, the Aam Aadmi Party
has been contesting Assembly
elections in at least 14 States out-

 

side Delhi, but has failed to win
even a single seat in 13 States.

The only State in which the
AAP tasted some victory was in
Punjab in 2017, where it won 20
seats and is the main Opposi-
tion. But AAP leaders said they
have learnt from their mistakes
and are focusing on organisation
building.

“In different States, the politi-

and have limited resources. But
we are making plans and follow-
ing it strictly,” Durgesh Pathak,
party in-charge of AAP’s ‘Nation-

The AAP MP said that in Uttar

outreach programme they have
at this point.

“It’s a door-to-door pro-

Freedom of speech intrinsic to democracy, says journalist

accused is involved in sev-

NEW DELHI

 

 

Journalist Priya Ramani on
Saturday sought acquittal in a
criminal defamation com-
plaint filed against her by
former Union Minister M.]J.
Akbar, saying freedom of
speech and expression is in-
trinsic to a democratic socie-
ty and her accusations of sex-
ual harassment against him
were “her truth”.

In the wake of the #MeToo
campaign, Ms. Ramani in
2018 accused Mr. Akbar of
sexual misconduct with her
around 20 years ago, when
he was a journalist. Mr. Akbar
resigned as a Union Minister
on October 17, 2018.

Freedom of speech

Mr. Ramani, who concluded
her arguments on Saturday in
the complaint filed against
her by Mr. Akbar, told the
court through her lawyer that
the #MeToo campaign was
started to correct the structu-
ral wrong, which was conti-

“The #MeToo movement
gave a platform to thousands
of women all across the world
to come forward and share
their stories of sexual harass-
ment. Freedom of speech
and expression is critical and
intrinsic to democracy. I [Ms.
Ramani] was a small part of a
large movement. I have
proved my case and I deserve
to be acquitted,” senior advo-
cate Rebecca John, appearing
on behalf of Ms. Ramani, told
Additional Chief Metropoli-
tan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja.

the lawyer added.

The court will hear the
matter again on October 13.

Ms. Ramani had earlier
told the court that she was
“targeted selectively”
through a criminal defama-
tion complaint by Mr. Akbar
“to halt the avalanche of alle-
gations of sexual misconduct
that came out against him” in
the wake of the #MeToo
movement.

Mr. Akbar had told the
court that Ms. Ramani had
defamed him by using adjec-
tives such as “media’s biggest
predator” to describe him,
which harmed his reputa-
tion. The BJP leader has de-
nied all allegations of sexual
harassment against him.

As many as 4,071 new CO-

in Delhi in the past 24
hours, taking the total num-
ber of cases to 2,42,899, ac-
cording to a health bulletin
released by the Delhi go-
vernment on Saturday.

Also, 38 fatalities have
been reported in a single
day, taking the death toll to
4,945. Of the total cases,
2,05,890 people have reco-
vered and there are 32,064
active cases.

Out of the total 14,652
beds available for COVID-19
treatment in the city,
53.03% were vacant, as per
government data on Satur-
day. But 61.3% of the ICU
beds with ventilators are
occupied and 72.42% of the
ICU beds without ventila-
tors are occupied.

The positivity rate (per-
centage of people testing
positive for every 100 tests
done) came down to 6.5%
on Saturday.

Health Minister Satyen-
dar Jain said the rate is less
compared to last week.

tal cumulative rate now is
less than 10% for the first
time. It is 9.83%. Earlier it

He said the average
death rate for the last 10
days is 0.69% and the case
fatality rate is 2.05%.

“In the past few days we
have increased more than
500 ICU beds in private
hospitals and more than
50% beds are vacant in hos-
pitals,” he added.

The Minister said that
the government was keep-
ing a strict watch and will
increase the beds if needed.
“When the number of cases
is this high in Delhi and rest
of the country, community
spread should have been
accepted. But only ICMR

its third week on Sunday.

The campaign now seeks
to engage Delhi residents to

10 of their friends/relatives
and advise them on the
good practices of preventing
dengue.

Launching the campaign

campaign against dengue, I
inspected my house again
and replaced the accumulat-
ed water. It only took me 10
minutes, you must also

Some preventive mea-
sures for dengue include
draining stagnant water
from home, surroundings,
and vases, changing the wa-
ter stored in coolers, or ad-
ding a small layer of oil or
petrol in the accumulated
water, and always covering

STAFF REPORTER

While hearing a plea on de-

Jheel as a water body, the Na-

has directed the Delhi and
Haryana governments to pre-
pare an environment plan
within three months to pre-
vent encroachment and con-

of the Environment Manage-

‘Revisit exemptions for poultry farms

Green panel tells CPCB such units can damage environment

STAFF REPORTER
NEW DELHI

Observing that operation of
poultry farms has the poten-
tial to damage the environ-
ment, the National Green
Tribunal has directed the
Central Pollution Control
Board (CPCB) to revisit exist-
ing guidelines that place
such units under the green
category, which exempts
them from various
regulations.

“Sustainable — develop-
ment is part of right to life.
Leaving out poultry farms
below 1 lakh birds unregu-
lated by State Pollution Con-
trol Boards (SPCBs) and
merely requiring registra-
tion with local bodies or
treating them at par with
agricultural farms, is against
the mandate of sustainable
development,” the NGT
Bench said, adding that only
small poultry farms with

less than 5,000 birds should
be placed in the green
category.

Fresh orders

Directing the CPCB to issue
fresh orders within three
months, the NGT Bench
said: “Till then, SPCBs can
strictly enforce environ-
mental norms and take re-
medial action against any
violation of water, air and
soil standards.”

 

 

 

 

said, adding that the CPCB
may coordinate as a nodal
agency.

The directions came when
the green panel was hearing
a plea moved by the Indian
National Trust for Art and
Cultural Heritage, which
sought execution of a 2017
NGT order. The plea had con-
tended that authorities had
failed to take appropriate

Besides Mr. Singh, the

Trio was in NIA custody till Saturday in Bhima-Koregaon violence case

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
MUMBAI

The National Investigation
Agency (NIA) court on Satur-
day remanded three Kabir
Kala Manch (KKM) artistes in
judicial custody till October
3 in the Bhima-Koregaon vio-
lence case.

While the NIA arrested Sa-
gar Gorkhe (32) and Ramesh
Gaichor (38) on September 7,
Jyoti Jagtap (2) was picked
up from Kondhwa in Pune
the next day. The NIA, ho-
wever, allowed the trio to
carry some books to read
and write. With the arrest of
the members of the Pune-
based cultural group, the
number of accused in the
case has gone up to 15.

Earlier, the trio was re-
manded in NIA custody till
September 19. Special public
prosecutor Prakash Shetty,
who appeared for the NIA,
had sought Ms. Jagtap’s cus-
tody on the ground that her
name figured in the original
FIR registered in the case on

 

 

January 8, 2018. Mr. Shetty
said Ms. Jagtap, along with
the other arrested accused,
hatched a “deep-rooted con-
spiracy” and committed se-
rious offences that had a
“severe social impact”.
While remanding Ms. Jag-
tap in police custody, Special
judge R.R. Bhosale had re-
corded that after the FIR was

lodged, several accused
were arrested and a probe
was launched. He said, “As
noticed, serious offences
having severe impact on so-
ciety are under investigation
since a long period. In this
situation, she requires to be
interrogated in the line of
the earlier progress of inves-
tigation. Prima facie, there is

sufficient material against
her for grant of custody.”

KKM comprises Dalit and
working class musicians and
poets who came together af-
ter the 2002 communal riots
in Gujarat. Their songs ques-
tion the impunity enjoyed by
the perpetrators of anti-Dalit
atrocities that occurred in
Ramabai Nagar in 1997 and
Khairlanji in 2006. Some of
their songs and performanc-
es feature in the National
Award-winning documen-
tary Jai Bhim Comrade. The
group is alleged to have links
with the banned Communist
Party of India (Maoist).

The trio organised the El-
gaar Parishad under the aus-
pices of the Bhima Koregaon
Shaurya Din Prerana Abhi-
yan on December 31, 2017,
which allegedly triggered the
violence at Bhima-Koregoan
the next day. They have been

Tiger kills
woman in
Yavatmal

PRESS TRUST OF INDIA
NAGPUR

A 60-year-old woman was
killed by a tiger at a village
in Pandharkawda forest di-
vision in Yavatmal district
on Saturday.

The woman was at-
tacked while she was work-
ing in a field at Mouza And-
harwadi village at 12 p.m.,
an official from Pandhar-
kawda forest department
said. The tiger from Tipesh-
war reserve has been on
the move in farms of And-
harwadi, Kopamandhvi,
Vasri and Kobai villages for
the last two months and
has preyed on cattle.

Personnel from the Spe-
cial Tiger Protection Force
from Melghat and forest
staff of Pandhakawda have
been tracking and monitor-
ing the tiger, he said.

The party alleged that the
Centre introduced Bills on
agriculture “without con-
sulting” its allies, farmers’
organisations or opposition
parties, and said the resigna-
tion of Union minister Har-
simrat Kaur Badal has
brought the issue to the fore.

In an editorial in its
mouthpiece Saamana, the
Sena said the National De-
mocratic Alliance (NDA) dur-

ing the time of former prime
minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
was “different” as they used
to “treat the NDA consti-
tuents with respect and con-
sult with them”. “Shiromani
Akali Dal [SAD] member Har-
simrat Kaur Badal has re-
signed from the Union Cabi-
net. The Modi government
brought two anti-farmer bills
[in Parliament] and she re-
signed in protest. The Shiv

Sena has already walked out
of the NDA and now comes
the SAD’s move,’ it said.
“During the time of Vaj-
payee, the NDA allies used to
be treated with respect, af-
fection and trust. There used
to be consultations on policy
decisions and BJP leaders
would hear out the views of
the allies. In those times,
spoken word had value,” the
Sena said in the editorial.

charged protesters, stu-
dents, academics and poets
with sedition and booked
them under the provisions
of the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act in the Delhi
riots case this year.

He said protesters were
labelled anti-national and
accused of “destabilising
the government”, but the
apex court found reasons
not to address the case.

Justice Shah made the
comments while delivering
the Justice Hosbet Suresh
Memorial Lecture on the
topic, ‘The Supreme Court
in Decline: Forgotten Free-
doms and Eroded Rights’,
through videoconferencing.
“The start of the Supreme
Court’s decline coincided
with the coming to power of
the BJP-led NDA govern-
ment in 2014. Every institu-
tion, mechanism or tool that
is designed to hold the exec-
utive accountable is being
systematically destroyed
since 2014,” he said.

A former chairperson of
the Law Commission, Jus-
tice Shah spoke about the
role of the Supreme Court in
different times. He said the
apex court is tilting more to-
wards the executive than
making it accountable
through constitutional me-

chanisms and institutions.
The court has failed to pro-
tect rights and counter ma-
joritarianism, he said.

Justice Shah cited the Sa-
barimala and Ayodhya judg-
ments, where the apex
court compromised the
principle of rule of law to
rule in the favour of the go-
vernment. “In the Ayodhya
judgment, the court despite
acknowledging the illegali-
ties committed by the Hin-
dus in 1949 and 1992, effec-
tively rewarded the
wrongdoer,” he said.

Justice Shah said the Su-
preme Court instead of deal-
ing with the issue of funda-
mental rights over the
internet and communica-
tion shutdown in Jammu &
Kashmir, handed over the is-
sue to the executive-led Spe-
cial Review Committee. He
said, “This has added to the
sufferings of the population
of Jammu & Kashmir on the
fronts of health, education,
business and economy.”

He said the opaque sys-
tem of “master of the ros-
ter” was central in the allo-
cation of cases to Benches
favourable to the executive.
“This system has eroded the
principle of independence
of the judiciary enshrined in
the Constitution,” he said.

 

 

 
  

 

Akalis feared loss of ! ‘Oppn. picking Congress ,

‘farmer’ vote bank

Quitting govt. is

 

‘nothing but a
face-saving act of
the party’

VIKAS VASUDEVA
CHANDIGARH

After flip-flops on the

Centre’s agriculture sector
legislations, the Shiromani
Akali Dal’s decision to quit
the government is being
seen as a last-ditch effort of
the party to save its core
“farmer” vote bank, said pol-
itical analysts.

They feel that the entire
episode shows the discon-
nect of the Akali Dal with the
masses, and for the party, it
would be a Herculean task to
win back the trust of its core
vote bank.

‘Not an easy task’
“The SAD extended support
to the ordinances, and it was
only after watching farmers’
anguish over the ordinances
that it took a U-turn on the is-
sue. Resignation of Ms. Har-
simrat Kaur Badal seems to
be a damage-control exer-
cise to appease farmers, who
had been their core vote
bank. But it may not be an
easy task. Farmers realise
that it was after their prot-
ests and agitations that the
Akali Dal took a decision to
back them, until then, the
party was supporting the or-
dinances,” said Ronki Ram,
Shaheed Bhaghat Singh
Chair professor of political
science at Panjab University.

“In the backdrop of this
episode, the farmers would
now be apprehensive of ex-
pectations from the Akali
Dal. What is the guarantee
that in future the party will
take up and address their
concerns on its own? The
Akali Dal will find it difficult
to convince farmers on this
question. It won't be an easy
task for the Akali Dal to re-
gain trust,” he said.

Another possible reason

 

ia >.
Harsimrat Kaur Badal
resigned on Thursday. =

behind the resignation has
been the pressure from with-
in the party. “Many leaders,
including seniors P.S. Chan-
dumajra and former Minis-
ter Sikander Singh Maluka,
had cautioned the party lea-
dership on the issue. This
pressure had also worked it
seems,” Mr. Ram added.

Ashutosh Kumar, profes-
sor of political science at
Panjab University, said the
episode showed the discon-
nect of the Akali Dal with the
masses. “The leadership fi-
nally realised that they are in
trouble of losing their vote
bank. They claim themselves
to be saviours of farmers, but
after seeing farmers’ prot-
ests surrounding the Bills,
the Akali Dal had to change
their stance,” he noted.

“It’s nothing but a face-
saving act of the party,” he
added.

Harsimrat’s letter

Ms. Harsimrat Badal in her
resignation letter to Prime
Minister Narendra Modi,
wrote, “In view of the deci-
sion of the Government of
India to go ahead with the
Bill on the issue of marketing
of agricultural produce with-
out addressing and remov-
ing the apprehensions of the
farmers and the decision of
my party, Shiromani Akali
Dal, not to be a part of anyth-
ing that goes against the in-
terests of the farmers, I find
it impossible to continue to
perform my duties as a Mi-
nister in the Union Council
of Ministers.”

manifestos selectively’

Nowhere had the
party spoken
about bringing
changes Centre is
imposing, says
Punjab CM

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
CHANDIGARH

 

Punjab Chief Minister Ama-
rinder Singh on Saturday ac-
cused the Aam Aadmi Party
of misleading the people by
picking selective portions of
Congress manifestos “which
did not even remotely pro-
pose” any of the anti-farmer
moves that the BJP-led
Centre government was try-
ing to push.

Instead of flashing the ma-
nifesto copies, AAP should
have made the effort to read
the relevant parts first, said
the Chief Minister in a
statement.

Referring to Congress ma-
nifestos for the Lok Sabha as
well as the last Punjab As-
sembly elections, Capt.
Amarinder pointed out that
nowhere had the party spo-
ken about bringing any of
the changes that the Centre
was trying to impose on the
nation with its legislations.
“In fact, the manifestos had
clearly talked about streng-
thening the APMC (Agricul-
ture Produce Marketing
Committee) system to make
it even more beneficial for
the farmers,” he said.

He said the State Congress
manifesto of 2017 had stated
that the updation of the
APMC Act would be done to
ensure direct access of farm-
ers to the national and inter-
national markets through
digital technology without
tinkering with the existing
Minimum Support Price sys-
tem, while the Lok Sabha
manifesto had gone a step
forward to talk of further
strengthening the marketing

 

AAP misleading people,
says Amarinder Singh »

system by repealing the ex-
isting Act and bringing in
new provisions that would
provide for establishment of
thousands of Kisan markets
to provide easy access to
farmers within a range of
two-three kilometres.

“When and where did the
Congress ever talk of replac-
ing APMC with contract
farming and private pro-
curement,’ the Chief Minis-
ter asked, lashing out at the
AAP for blatantly misleading
the people on the issue.

Officer shifted

Separately on Saturday, a
Block Development and
Panchayat Officer (BPDO)
was shifted for issuing a let-
ter claiming that a farmers’
protest would be organised
by the Punjab government
over the issue of the farm or-
dinances on September 21.

Taking serious cogni-
sance of the matter, the
Chief Minister ordered shift-
ing of the Sardulgarh BDPO
to the headquarters, and im-
mediate withdrawal of the
letter issued by him regard-
ing some farm protests
which he _ incorrectly
claimed to have been organ-
ised by the Punjab govern-
ment, a government state-
ment said here.

The directions came a day
after Shiromani Akali Dal

INTERVIEW | LALCHAND KATARIA

‘Bill will affect welfare measures

Application of State's Act will be restricted: Rajasthan Minister

MOHAMMED IQBAL

The market fee and farmers’
welfare cess will come down
sharply in the coming years,
adversely affecting mandis
and various welfare mea-
sures as a result of the Farm-
ers’ Produce Trade & Com-
merce Bill, says Lalchand
Kataria in an interview.
Excerpts:

How is the Farmers’ Produce
Trade & Commerce
(Promotion and Facilitation)
Bill, 2020, going to affect the
functioning of mandis? What
is the Rajasthan
government’s plan for
utilisation of 2% farmers’
welfare cess?

= The Bill will restrict the ap-
plication of the Rajasthan
Agricultural Produce Mar-
kets Act, 1961, to the physi-
cal boundaries of mandis
and sub-yards managed and
run by the market commit-
tees formed under the law.
The warehouses, silos, cold
storages or other structures
notified as deemed markets
will also feel the impact in
addition to the direct collec-
tion centres and farmer-con-
sumer yards managed by
persons holding licences.
The market fee and cess will
come down sharply in the
coming years, adversely af-
fecting mandis and various

: welfare measures for agri-

culturalists. The 2% cess was
imposed to facilitate ease of
doing farming and boost fi-
nancial resources. It will be
utilised for activities such as
post-harvest management,
market intervention and
pledge loan scheme.

How did the COVID-19
lockdown affect the
agriculture sector in
Rajasthan?

u The lockdown made a ne-
gligible impact on the agri-
culture sector though there

: were difficulties in smooth

movement of harvesting ma-

chinery initially. Agriculture
input shops and machine
part shops were allowed to
remain open and mandis
were also exempted from
the lockdown. Farmers were
able to sell their produce
close to their fields with new
mandis being opened and
direct purchase licences be-
ing issued.

What steps is the government
taking to strengthen the rural
economy?

mu The gradual opening of
lockdown has helped in get-
ting agricultural labourers
and reviving the market, es-
pecially for perishable farm
commodities like fruits, ve-
getables and flowers. The
State government has pro-
vided 8.1 lakh maize and 8.2
lakh pear! millet mini-kits to
farmers free during the kha-
rif season.

Through a tie-up with
Tractors and Farm Equip-
ment Limited, rent-free
equipment was provided to
small and marginal farmers.
The time limit for repay-
ment of short-term coopera-
tive loans has been
extended.

Was the procurement of
wheat, gram and mustard up
to the expected levels?

 

 

a A record procurement of
wheat and black gram at
MSP has been achieved this
year. Against the Central go-
vernment’s target of 21.24
lakh tonnes wheat, 22.25
lakh tonnes were procured
from 2.19 lakh farmers, who
were paid %4,282 crore. Simi-
larly, 6.16 lakh tonnes gram
was procured from 2.38 lakh
farmers and 23,001 crore
were paid. The procurement
of rapeseed and mustard at
3.47 lakh tonnes was less be-
cause the market price was
higher than the MSP.

Have schemes like the
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima
Yojana benefited the
farmers?

= More than 1 crore farmers
in the State have benefited
from the PMFBY since 2016,
with claims worth %10,700
crore paid to them. In the re-
vamped scheme, the Central
government has capped its
previous share of premium
subsidy in the ratio of 50:50
to only 25% in irrigated areas
and 30% in unirrigated
areas. Because of this, the
State government has to pay
%138 crore more than the
Centre for insurance of kha-
rif crops in 2020.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot
has laid emphasis on
connecting the farmers with
the industry and increasing
their income. How will you
help the farmers in this
respect and promote value
addition in agriculture?

a The Rajasthan Agro-Pro-
cessing, Agri-Business and
Agri-Export Promotion Poli-
cy, 2019, has been formulat-
ed keeping in mind the deve-
lopment of supply and value
chains with special empha-
sis on a cluster-based ap-
proach. The 50% subsidy
provision for aggregation
and collection centres, pack-
house, warehouse, cold stor-
age, reefer van, etc., will
strengthen the supply chain.

Department denies incident of alleged custodial thrashing of rights activists

SIDHARTH YADAV
BHOPAL

More than 1,000 villagers sus-
pended their sit-in on the
fourth day on Saturday in
Burhanpur district after two
forest guards were suspend-
ed for allegedly thrashing two
rights activists in custody last
month.

The agitation outside the
Nepanagar police station, led
by the Jagrit Adivasi Dalit San-
gathan (JADS), started on
September 16 after its com-
plaints calling for action
against the forest officials res-
ponsible went unheard.

Police probe

Meanwhile, the police has
started an inquiry into the al-
leged illegal arrest of JADS ac-
tivists Kailash Jamre (38) and
Pyar Singh Waskale (42) from
the Burhanpur district court

complex on August 30,
where they had gone to se-
cure bail for two other acti-

vists, and their alleged
thrashing at the Khaknar
range office.

“The inquiry is based on
the complaint filed by the or-
ganisation. Further action
will be taken after its comple-

tion,” said Additional Supe-
rintendent of Police Mahen-
dra Tarnekar.

JADS demanded an FIR
against the Range Officer un-
der the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes (Preven-
tion of Atrocities) Act, 1989,
and his arrest, said Nitin
Varghese of the organisation.

Rubbishing the allegation,
Khandwa Chief Conservator
of Forests Mahendra Singh Si-
sodia told The Hindu,
“Anyone can make any alle-
gation... we have launched
no internal inquiry.”

However, orders issued by
the Forest Department con-
firmed forest guards Rajiv So-
lanki and Rupa Mudiya were
suspended owing to negli-
gence.

Claiming he was hand-
cuffed and beaten with ba-
tons at the range office, Mr.
Jamre said forest officials
were visibly irked at him for
spreading awareness on for-
est laws. “They told us — ‘let’s
see who comes to rescue
you’.” He claimed foresters
were upset over his having
complained to the district of-
ficials about illegal felling of
trees recently.

Rename museum after Surajmal, demand Jats

Community organisation says Shivaji didn’t do much for the Braj region

ANUJ KUMAR
GHAZIABAD

The renaming of the Mughal
Museum in Agra by Uttar
Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi
Adityanath after Maratha
warrior Shivaji has opened a
Pandora’s box.

Even as the officials of the
Tourism department were
scratching their heads to
find a cogent link of Shivaji
with Agra, the Jat Mahasab-
ha on Friday presented a
memorandum addressed to
the Chief Minister to the dis-
trict administration de-
manding that the museum
be named after Jat ruler Su-
rajmal as he ruled parts of
the Braj area for a significant
period of time and he and
his son Jawahar Singh
emerged as strong counter
forces to the Mughals in the
region.

Kaptan Singh Chahar, the
district president of the Ma-
hasabha, said that though
they had great respect for
Chhatrapati Shivaji, he
didn’t do much for the

 

region.

“In fact, when he was im-
prisoned by the Mughals
during Aurangzeb’s reign,
Raja Surajamal’s forefather
Rajaram Jat helped him es-
cape from Agra when he was
imprisoned in the haveli of
Ram Singh,” he claimed.

‘Getting bizarre’

Ali Nadeem Rezavi, eminent
historian and former chair-
person of the history depart-
ment at Aligarh Muslim Un-
iversity, said it is getting
bizarre by the day. “Having
burned the bones of Akbar
by digging up his grave (in
Sikandra), they (Jats) have a
better claim for the mu-
seum!” he wondered.

Mr. Chahar said it was a
reaction to the brutal killing
of farmer rebel Gokula dur-
ing Aurangzeb’s reign.

U.P. Tourism department
Deputy Director Amit Shri-
vastava said the government
had roped in a private archi-
tectural firm, Archohm, to
chalk out a business plan for

the museum.

Sanctioned during the Sa-
majwadi Party government,
the museum is located on
the eastern gate of the Taj
Mahal. “It is a %194-crore
project out of which %72
crore has been sanctioned
so far. It will take at least a
year for it to be completed.”

On what will be displayed
in the museum, Mr. Shrivas-
tava said it was still early
days but confirmed a part of
it would be dedicated to Braj
culture.

Manvendra Kumar Pund-
hir, professor of history at
AMU, said Braj culture had
no links with Shivaji. “And if
it is about Braj culture, how
far will you go back? Will the
Kushana artefacts also be in-
cluded?” he said.

For Braj culture, he said,
it would be better to create a
research centre in Mathura
or surrounding areas of ar-
chaeological importance.

Lamenting that we are liv-
ing in times when ignorance
and hate reigns supreme,

Prof. Rezavi said, “To date,
records of Mughal grants to
Vrindavan temples survive.”
He felt as per well-laid-out
traditions, the site of mu-
seum dictated the theme.

‘Continuous history’
Asking what’s in a name, Su-
gam Anand, head and pro-
fessor of history at Dr. Bhim-
rao Ambedkar University,
Agra, said the city’s history
was not limited to one pe-
riod. “It is almost a continu-
ous history. So, if a museum
is built, I believe it should
showcase as many facets of
its past as possible,” he said.
Remains of Buddhist,
Jain, Shakya and Vaishnav
temples have been found in
the region, said Prof. Anand.
Naming an institution, he
said, was often a political
tool used by the government
of the day. “If it was named
Mughal Museum, I would
have still liked it to reflect a
comprehensive study of
Agra’s past and not just a
part of medieval history.”

Miles to go for a safer
childbirth in Kalahandi

The ordeal of the new moth-
ers does not end with child-
birth as they face the pun-
ishing return journeys
home with their fragile new-
borns.

However, despite the im-
mense challenges, an in-
creasing number of women
have been opting for an in-
stitutional delivery.

Of the 40 deliveries re-
ported from the water-
locked 16 villages in 2019-
20, 13 were recorded from
the hospital. Further, a ma-
jority of women who had
delivered their babies at
home, came to the hospital
for antenatal care.

Role of health workers
The deployment of Accre-
dited Social Health Activists
(ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurs-
ing Midwives (ANMs) in the
16 villages proved to be the
turning point. The health
workers persuaded the wo-
men to opt for institutional
deliveries. Moreover, a con-
ditional transfer of %5,000
as maternity benefit under
the ‘Mamata Scheme’, refer-
ral transport assistance and
an additional 71,000 in tran-
sport costs for women in in-
accessible areas have also
encouraged them to ap-
proach hospitals.

The expenses incurred
on institutional deliveries
for the women of N Podapa-
dar, however, far exceed the
benefits extended by the go-
vernment. The two-way
boat ride across the reser-
voir and the autorickshaw
trip cost around %2,200,
while a woman is entitled to
a transport subsidy of
%1,400 only. The additional
21,000 transport cost an-
nounced by the government
is yet to reach many of the

beneficiaries.

Added to this are the ex-
penses borne by the family
members or friends who
must needs accompany the
woman on the long journey
and her stay at the hospital.
Each day also means loss of
earnings for these daily
wage labourers.

“More than 200 villages,
mostly in remote areas of
Nabarangpur and Kalahandi
districts, depend on our
hospital. We register about
700 births every year. Des-
pite difficult terrain hinder-
ing access to health servic-
es, more and more mothers
are coming forward for insti-

tutional deliveries,” said
D.B. Panda, a doctor at Ten-
tulikhunti CHC.

TRS to vote
against farm
Bills in RS

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
HYDERABAD

With seven members, the
Telangana Rashtra Samiti
(TRS) has decided to vote
against the farm Bills when
they came up before the
Rajya Sabha on Sunday.

TRS president and Te-
langana Chief Minister K.
Chandrasekhar Rao has
asked the party MPs of the
Upper House to stoutly op-
pose the three Bills and
vote against them as they
were a severe detriment to
farming community.

He told the TRS leader in
Rajya Sabha K. Keshava
Rao that the Centre aimed
to benefit corporate hous-
es at the cost of farmers by
enacting the laws. “On the
face of it, the Centre pro-
vided in the Bills that the
farmers can sell their pro-
duce anywhere. But, the
government paved the way
for corporates to go
anywhere to buy the pro-
duce. The corporate sharks
can spread their wings
throughout the country.
Thus, the doors will open
to private trade,” a release
quoting Mr. Rao said.

The Ladakh administration
on Saturday announced
that the election for the La-

velopment Council-Leh
(LADHC-Leh) will be held
on October 16 in 26
constituencies.

“The voting will take
place on October 16 in 26
constituencies of the Coun-
cil,” said Saugat Biswas, Se-
cretary, Election Depart-
ment, in a notice.

Sachin Kumar Vaishya,
District Magistrate, Leh,
announced a model code
of conduct for the district
and directed all political
parties and independent
candidates to follow the
guidelines.

The decision comes
amid the objections raised
recently by some major
parties like the Congress,
the Aam Aadmi Party
(AAP) and the BSP. The
parties argued that the on-
going Indo-China border
tensions have left many
border areas out of bounds
for campaigning.

issues at the local level.
The previous polls were

Army races to stock for winter

Thousands of troops need to dig in along the LAC in sub-zero temperatures

As India and China prepare
for another round of Corps
Commander-level talks for
disengagement and de-esca-

boundary in Ladakh, the Ar-
my is racing to complete ad-
vance winter stocking in for-
ward locations and build
habitat for the thousands of
additional troops deployed
in high-altitude areas along
the Line of Actual Control
(LAC), a defence source said.

The sixth round of talks
are likely to be held in the
next two or three days,
another defence source said.
Ahead of the talks, the
ground situation and future
course of action was re-
viewed at a high-level go-
vernment meeting on
Friday.

“Tt is not just about stocks
reaching Leh. Its about the
rations and other essentials

where troops are deployed.
It is under way in full swing.
Then there is also storage.
Stocks cannot be left out in
the open. There are limita-
tions of storage space with
additional stocks coming in.
They are also being created,”
the source said. In Leh, hea-

After Harsimrat Kaur Badal

stepped down as Minster
from the Union Cabinet in
protest against the Centre’s
three agriculture sector

but when that did not seem
possible, and a line had to be
drawn, it stood on the right

MSMEs not to be hit by
new IBC Bill: Minister

Sitharaman says it’s not a recovery law

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
NEW DELHI

The Rajya Sabha on Satur-
day passed the Insolvency
and Bankruptcy Code Ge-
cond Amendment) Bill
(BC), 2020, to ensure that
fresh insolvency proceed-
ings will not be initiated for
at least six months starting
March 25 amid the COVID-19
pandemic. The Bill replaces
an Ordinance passed in
June.

Finance Minister Nirmala
Sitharaman informed the
Rajya Sabha on Saturday
that the IBC is not a recov-
ery law, and saving the lives
of the companies is more
important than recovery of
loans, which may be utilised
through other options.

She said that there is a
distinction between small
and large borrowers, and
the amount varies from 21
lakh to 21 crore. “IBC cannot
be initiated for companies
below %1 crore, so Micro,
Small and Medium and En-
terprises (MSME) are not go-
ing to be affected,” she said.

The Finance Minister said
that the provisions of the
IBC will be confined to only
those default payments that
may arise due to the CO-
VID-19 period, and will not
affect the applications filed
before March 24, when the

M
K

lockdown was imposed.
“The Ordinance and the
Bill does not provide any
protection to frauds. Sec-
tion 166 of the Companies
Act, 2013 remains intact,
thus there is no protection
from fraud. If the company
is pushed into insolvency
when it is recouping from
losses, the objective of the
Ordinance will be lost.”

‘258 companies rescued’
The Minister added that, so
far, 258 companies had
been rescued, and roughly
one-third were defunct
companies. “Nine hundred
and sixty five companies
proceeded for liquidation,
three-fourth of them were
defunct, loss of employ-
ment is minimal even after
liquidation. The 965 compa-
nies had assets of 738,000
crore, so in value terms, the
asset saved is more than li-
quidated,” she said.

She added that when it
came to non-performing as-
sets (NPA) of scheduled
commercial banks, then in
the year 2018-19, the IBC en-
sured 42.5% recovery or
17,819 crore recovery, whe-
reas such recoveries made

“The party tried to act as
a bridge to find an amicable
way to accommodate the
farmers’ interests. But I am
glad that when that did not
seem possible, it did the on-
ly thing that its proud herit-
age demanded — quit the go-
vernment. The SAD could
never be a party to anything
which harms the interests of
the farmers.”

Mr. Badal said the farm-
ers’ issue relates to the over-
all national interests.

The former Chief Minister
said with the resignation of
its sole representative in the
Union Cabinet, SAD has de-
monstrated yet again that
nothing is dearer to it than
its principles and the inter-
ests of the people, especially
the farmers, the farm labour
and other poor classes who

The logistical manage-
ment needs careful planning
so that supplies to high-alti-
tude areas in other sectors is
not affected, the source said.

The Army has moved
around 30,000 troops to La-
dakh and forward areas
since the beginning of the
stand-off in May, and the
massive build-up of forces by
China at several places in La-
dakh and along the LAC.
Stating that with these addi-

tional troops, there is not
enough warm habitat availa-
ble to house them in the
peak winter, the source said
orders have been placed in
time and work is on to set
them up. “Extra engineering
task forces have been moved
but they are racing against
time,” the defence source

The second source said
that since the meeting bet-
ween External Affairs Minis-
ter S. Jaishankar and Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi in

the situation has been quiet
along the LAC. The Ministers
had agreed on a five-point

The Jammu and Kashmir

dropped by a drone from

“Three persons had tra-

Cong. justifies objections to

Bills despite similar promises

Chidambaram accuses BJP of ‘surrendering to corporates’

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
NEW DELHI

With the Rajya Sabha set to
consider the agriculture
marketing reform Bills on
Sunday amid protests from
most of the Opposition, the
Congress is trying to refute
the ruling BJP’s narrative
that it had promised similar
reforms in its own election
manifesto last year.

Rajya Sabha member and
Congress leader P. Chidam-
baram said the party had
promised to promote farm-
ers’ companies and markets
with sufficient infrastructure
before repealing the existing
laws.

The BJP is accusing the
Congress of duplicity in its
opposition to the two Bills
that promote barrier-free
trade and facilitate the sale
of farm produce outside the
mandis notified under the
Agricultural Produce Market
Committee.

In its 2019 poll manifesto,

 

 

P. Chidambaram

the Congress had gone a step
further, saying it would “re-
peal the Agricultural Pro-
duce Market Committees
(APMC) Act and make trade
in agricultural produce — in-
cluding exports and inter-
State trade — free from all
restrictions”.

Mr. Chidambaram noted
that the Congress manifesto
had also promised to “pro-
mote Farmers Producer
Companies/Organisations to
enable farmers to access in-
puts, technology and mar-
kets,” and to “establish farm-

ers’ markets with adequate
infrastructure and support
in large villages and small
towns to enable the farmer
to bring his/her produce and
freely market the same”. On-
ly after these promises were
accomplished, giving farm-
ers the choice of multiple ac-
cessible markets would the
Congress have gone on to re-
peal the APMC Act, he
claimed. “The Prime Minis-
ter and the BJP spokesper-
sons have deliberately and
maliciously distorted the
Congress Manifesto,” said
his statement.

Mr. Chidambaram ac-
cused the BJP of “surrender-
ing to corporates and trad-
ers” and “undermining the
only regulated market avail-
able to the farmer today,
without creating thousands
of alternative markets that
will be accessible to the
farmer”.

The Bills were passed by
the Lok Sabha on Thursday.

“Doctors have advised

Opposition trains guns on PM CARES

Lok Sabha passes taxation Bill; Congress, Trinamool MPs say it is meant only to clear the fund

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
NEW DELHI

The Lok Sabha cleared the
Taxation and Other Laws
(Relaxation and Amendment
of Certain Provisions) Bill,
2020, here on Saturday, des-
pite strong criticism from the
Opposition which said the
Bill was aimed at giving an
“all clear to the PM CARES
Fund”.

Finance Minister Nirmala
Sitharaman said the Bill will
replace an ordinance
brought in to help the com-
mon man during the CO-
VID-19 times.

‘Absolutely transparent’
Minister of State for Finance
Anurag Thakur in his res-
ponse to the debate on the
Bill, said the PM CARES
Fund was absolutely tran-
sparent and had been set up
under the law and registered
as a Trust under the 1908
Act.

Questioning the distrust

 

Making a point: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
addressing the Parliament on Saturday. =et

about the fund, Mr. Thakur
asked, “Is there any past ex-
perience which has caused
it? PM CARES Fund today

than the PM National Relief
Fund.”

The Minister added that
earlier, “public funds and go-
vernment machinery were
misused and diverted by one
specific family-owned foun-
dations/funds and charitable
trust in India.”

Tata Group to unveil
India’s first CRISPR test

Test has RT-PCR accuracy, is quicker

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
MUMBAI

The Tata Group has an-
nounced that the Tata
CRISPR test, developed by
CSIR-IGIB ‘Feluda’ (Council
of Scientific and Industrial
Research-Institute of Ge-
nomics and Integrative Biol-
ogy) had received regulato-
ry approvals on Saturday
from the Drug Controller
General of India (DCGD for
commercial roll-out in ac-
cordance with the Indian
Council of Medical Research
(ICMR) guidelines.

The test has met high
benchmarks, with 96% sen-
sitivity and 98% specificity
for detecting the novel coro-
navirus. It uses indigenously
developed CRISPR technol-
ogy for the detection of the
genomic sequence of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus.

“The Tata CRISPR test is
the world’s first diagnostic
test to deploy a specially
adapted Cas9 protein to suc-

cessfully detect the virus
causing COVID-19. This
marks a significant achieve-
ment for the Indian scientif-
ic community, moving from
R&D to a_ high-accuracy,
scalable and reliable test in
less than 100 days,” Tata
Group said in a statement.

The Tata CRISPR test
achieves the accuracy levels
of the traditional RT-PCR
(real-time polymerase chain
reaction) tests, with quicker
turnaround time, less ex-
pensive equipment, and
better ease of use, it said.

The effort is the result of
collaboration between the
scientific community and
industry. The Tata Group
worked closely with CSIR-
IGIB and ICMR to create a
high-quality test that will
help India ramp up CO-
VID-19 testing quickly and
economically, with a ‘Made
in India’ product that is safe,
reliable, affordable, and ac-
cessible, it said.

Questioning why the
members of “this one family
aren’t behind bars despite
the repeated accusations”,
Congress leader in the House
Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury
said the government must
give clear details of Chinese
donations to the PM CARES
Fund.

“I also want to ask the
need for creating a parallel
fund when PM National Re-
lief Fund is there,” he said.

Trinamool Congress MP
Mahua Moitra said the
“deeply problematic Bill”
was being brought in to give
an all clear to the PM CARES
Fund which is covered in
non-transparency.

“The discriminatory pro-
visions of the Fund also wea-
ken the rights and resources
available to State govern-
ments by taking away statu-
tory promises made under
the new GST regime. It cor-
ners the public funds for PM
CARES depriving even the
Chief Minister’s relief funds
and in turn making State go-
vernments suffer,” she said.

‘Foreign donations’

Questioning the govern-
ment’s decision to accept
contributions for PM CARES,
which, she said, is not open
for audit, from firms in China
operating spy organisations
and running mobile applica-
tions banned in India, Ms.
Moitra said, “This unverified

foreign donation is
dangerous.”

She added that the go-
vernment was also hiding
the fact that 70% of funds to
PM CARES came from public
sector undertakings, which
was also public money.

Manickam Tagore of the
Congress said through the
PM CARES Fund, the only
people served were corpo-
rates that turned black mo-
ney into white. “The govern-
ment must tell us why the
government is privatising
airports/telecom and other
services. Who exactly is run-
ning the country? Is this a de-
mocracy,” he asked.

Though supporting the
Bill, K. Ram Mohan Naidu of
the TDP said the government
should allow transparency in
public funds. “This will en-
sure reinforcement of public
trust. The government
should consider releasing
GST revenue to States,” he
said.

The decommissioned air-

US. Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg dies -

A liberal and legal icon, she died at the age of 87 from complications caused by pancreatic cancer

SRIRAM LAKSHMAN
WASHINGTON

 

U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liber-
al and legal icon, died on Fri-
day at the age of 87 from
complications caused by me-
tastatic pancreatic cancer.
Democrats and Republicans
reacted to news of her death
with grief even as they drew
battle lines over the possibil-
ity of finding a replacement
justice before the elections.

At just over 5 feet tall,
Ginsburg was considered a
giant in the legal world. As a
lawyer, she argued cases be-
fore the Supreme Court to
expand, in stages, the ambit
of the U.S. Constitution’s
14th Amendment on equal
protection to cover gender
discrimination.

Born in 1933 to a Jewish fa-
mily in Brooklyn, she faced
numerous challenges as she
worked her way to the high-
est court in the land. She lost
her mother at 17, entered an
almost exclusively male
world of lawyers and judges,
helped her husband Martin
(Marty’) Ginsburg through
cancer while they both at-
tended Harvard Law School
and raised children. Her
marriage to Martin Ginsburg

— who campaigned for his
wife’s supreme court nomi-
nation and took on work at
home traditionally expected
of women — would become
one of the defining partner-
ships of her life.

Oldest SC Justice

In 1993, then President Bill
Clinton appointed her to the
Supreme Court — the second
woman in that position. At
the time of her death, she
would become the oldest Su-
preme Court justice and the
most senior of the liberal jus-
tices. In her 27 years on the
court, in writing majority
opinions and dissents she

became a_ liberal icon
through her support for gen-
der equality, women’s rights,
same sex marriage, streng-
thening the Voting Rights Act
and so forth.

Ginsburg’s reputation for
toughness extended outside
the court. She had fought off
cancer twice in her life.
Treatment for a fall that
broke three of her ribs in
2018 led doctors to discover
that she had cancer, for the
third time.

She had repeatedly said
she would work as long as
she could physically man-
age: the 5-4 conservative-lib-
eral split in the court, with

Chief Justice John Roberts so-
metimes voting with liberals,
would become even more
conservative had Ginsburg
retired. Just days before her
death, Ginsburg said she
hoped a replacement would
not be found before the pre-
sidential elections.

“My most fervent wish is
that I will not be replaced un-
til a new President is in-
stalled,” she had said ina dic-
tated statement to her
grand-daughter Clara Spera.

Popular icon
In recent years, Justice Gins-
burg’s reputation extended
beyond feminism and the
law, as she became an icon in
popular culture. Known col-
loquially as the ‘Notorious
RBG’ ( named after the late
rapper Notorious BIG) mugs,
action figures, stickers, T-
shirts and books, including
one by her personal trainer
on the ‘RBG Workout’ featur-
ing Ginsburg started emerg-
ing. The Justice was known
to have a tough workout regi-
men even in her 80s that in-
cluded lifting weights and
doing push-ups.

In the hours after news of
her death broke, mourners
gathered outside the Su-

preme Court here in Wash-
ington, bringing candles and
flowers to mark Justice Gins-
burg’s life and passing.

President Donald Trump
appeared to be taken aback
when he was told of the
news by reporters after a
campaign event in Minneso-
ta. “She just died? Wow,” he
said. “She led an amazing
life... what else can you say.
She was an amazing wo-
man... whether you agreed
or not, she was amazing wo-
man who led an amazing life.
I’m actually sad to hear
that.” He later issued a state-
ment praising her. In 2016,
Justice Ginsburg had called
Mr. Trump “a faker”, words
she later apologised for, say-
ing judges should refrain
from commenting on candi-
dates running for office.

Democratic presidential
nominee Joe Biden called
Ginsburg “not only a giant in
the legal profession but a be-
loved figure”. Mr. Biden said
the short-term focus was on
the loss of the justice and her
legacy but “there is no
doubt, let me be clear that
the voters should pick the
President and the President
should pick the justice for
the Senate to consider.”

Battle begins for Ginsburg’s replacement

Within hours of U.S. Su-
preme Court Justice Ruth

away from the presidential

Two killed, 14 wounded

WASHINGTON

Two people were killed and
14 wounded early on Saturday
in a shooting at a backyard
party in Rochester, New York
state, police said. Officers
responding to reports of
gunfire in the area found a
“chaotic scene" with about
100 people running in various
directions, interim police
chief Mark Simmons told
reporters. arp

Mitch McConnell issued a
condolence message on Fri-
day night praising Justice
Ginsburg’s life but also say-
ing, “President Trump’s no-
minee will receive a vote on
the floor of the U.S. Senate.”
In 2016, he had blocked a
(GOP controlled) Senate con-
firmation vote on former
U.S. President Barack Oba-
ma’s justice nominee Mer-
rick Garland eleven months

before the election.
Referring to the 2016 con-
firmation issue following
conservative justice Antonin
Scalia’s death, Mr. McCon-
nell’s statement said that
since the 1880s, no Senate
has confirmed the nominee
of an opposite-party Presi-
dent. Mr. McConnell’s state-
ment came despite Justice
Ginsburg’s final public wish
that a new justice not be

found till after the election.

By Saturday morning, Pre-
sident Donald Trump had
signalled his intent to nomi-
nate a new justice. The Presi-
dent, who has already filled
two SC seats with conserva-
tive justices, tweeted to the
GOP on the importance of
selection of SC justices: “We
have this obligation, without
delay!” he wrote.

His opponent, Democratic

presidential nominee Joe Bi-

Abe visits controversial war shrine

Former PM’°s visit to the symbol of Japan's militaristic past sparks concerns

Former Japanese Prime Mi-
nister Shinzo Abe visited the
controversial Yasukuni
Shrine for war dead on Sa-
turday, his first visit since De-
cember 2013, after refraining
from doing so for most of his
term to avoid angering China
and South Korea.

Mr. Abe announced the vi-
sit on his official Twitter ac-
count along with a photo of
himself at the shrine, just
days after Yoshihide Suga
succeeded him as Japan’s
leader. Japan’s longest-serv-
ing leader announced his re-
signation in late August, cit-
ing health problems.

The shrine is seen by Beij-
ing and Seoul as a symbol of
Japan’s past military aggres-
sion because it honours 14 Ja-
panese wartime leaders con-
victed as war criminals by an
Allied tribunal as well as war
dead.

Beijing comes out with list of ‘unreliable’ American entities

China on Saturday launched
a mechanism that would al-
low it to sanction foreign
companies, upping the ante
in a tech war with the U.S. a
day after Washington moved
to curb popular Chinese

ing against TikTok and
WeChat.

Its implementation comes
just a day after the U.S. Com-
merce Department stepped
up the pressure by ordering
a ban on downloads of video
app TikTok and effectively
blocking use of WeChat, the
Chinese super-app.

An announcement by Chi-

But it said the new system
would consider sanctions on
entities whose activities
“harm China’s national sove-

“internationally accepted

‘Aim to regain traders’ bank tag’

Keen on commercial loans below %25 crore, says KVB MD

N. ANAND

The 104-year-old private sec-
tor lender Karur Vysya
Bank Ltd., popularly known
as a trader’s bank, plans to
regain its right to the appel-
lation by foraying aggres-
sively into metal loans and
co-lending. Current account
and savings bank accounts
will be major focus areas,
the bank’s MD and CEO, B.
Ramesh Babu, said in an
interview. Excerpts:

What was the impact of
COVID-19 on operations?

= Currently, transactions at
the branch level remain low.
Customers have started us-
ing other channels, as also
KVB Dlite, a mobile banking
app. Current account and
savings account (CASA) con-
tribution has gone up from
31% to 35%.

People who don’t want to
spend are retaining money
in their savings accounts. Ac-
count openings during the
pandemic outnumbered
closures.

What are your plans for the
current year?

= Going forward, CASA will
be the top-most focus area
on the liability side. So, all
the branches will focus on
opening mid-segment cur-
rent and savings bank ac-
counts. On the advances
side, we consider loans up to
%25 crore as corporate loans.

Earlier, we were taking ex-
posure up to %200-300
crore. Now, we have taken a
call to limit exposure to 7125
crore per corporate
account.

Our higher exposures
have been brought down to
%125 crore. Even today, we
have about 10 accounts
that are of government-
owned firms and have
good track record.

The way forward for these
accounts is, we will grow,
but it will be below %125
crore or 7100-75 crore.

Our main focus would be
on the commercial segment
which is below $25 crore. We
have 800 branches [catering
to such accounts], and we
want to leverage the con-
nect. KVB was actually a
traders’ bank and had a lot
of relationship banking. We
want to go back to basics.

Any special focus areas?

The bank will aggressively
look at precious metals, that
is, providing gold loans to je-
wellers and manufacturers.
Earlier, our customers
used to take metal gold loans
from other banks by using

want and later extend it to
others. We will import gold

On an average, we have gi-
ven %1,500 crore worth of
non-fund base limits to our
own customers. It is readily
on our platter. We expect to
grow by %600 crore on this
account alone this year.

What about consortium
lending?

u Earlier we were a member
of many consortiums. We
were taking some 5% and if
something happened, we
had no say. That is the only
reason we are seriously re-
considering; if we do not
have a bigger share in the
consortium, let us say 20%
or 25%, then there is no
point being a part of [a con-
sortium].

But, if it is an excellent
company and the conces-
sion rate is also pretty good,
we can [participate] to the
extent possible. But, we may
not go for smaller exposures
in a consortium.

Your take on co-lending?
u We have started co-lend-
ing with a few of the syste-
matically important non-
banking, non-deposit taking
financial institutions. People
can enter into an arrange-
ment wherein, they can
source the loan and pass it
through our own system.

The loans will be sanc-
tioned and disbursed dig-
itally with no manual in-
tervention. We have tied
up with seven NBFCs to
take advantage of their
wherewithal and foot-
print.

This _ particular
route may help us to
get more business.

External risks,
but China’s
economy still
resilient: Xi

China’s economy remains
resilient and there are am-
ple policy tools at Beijing’s
disposal despite rising ex-
ternal risks, President Xi

Jinping said in remarks pu-

blished on Saturday.

The world’s second-lar-
gest economy has steadily
recovered from a virus-in-
duced slump, but analysts
say policymakers face a
tough job to maintain sta-
ble expansion over the
next several years to turn
China into a high-income
nation.

“The basic characteris-
tics of China’s economy
with sufficient potential,
great resilience, strong vi-
tality, large space for ma-
noeuvre and many policy
instruments have not
changed,” Xinhua news
agency quoted Mr. Xi as
saying.

China has strong manu-
facturing capacity, very
large domestic markets
and huge investment po-
tentials, he said.

Mr. Xi reaffirmed a “dual
circulation” strategy that
would help steer the eco-
nomy towards greater self-
reliance, as U.S. hostility
and a global pandemic in-
crease external risks.

China still enjoyed “stra-
tegic opportunities” in its
development, although the
COVID-19 pandemic has ex-
acerbated global challeng-
es as globalisation slows
and unilateralism and pro-
tectionism are rising, Mr.
Xi was quoted as saying at a
meeting on the country’s

14th five-year plan
(2021-2025).
“We must seek our deve-

lopment in a more unsta-
ble and uncertain world,”
he said.

“The great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation can
never be achieved easily
with the beating of gongs
and drums,” Mr. Xi added.

Protection against SARS-CoV-2 may be short-lived

Since reinfection can occur, the only safe and effective way to achieve herd immunity may be through vaccination

R. PRASAD
While it is generally known
that protective immunity
against the four species of
common cold coronaviruses
does not last for more than
year, a study that monitored
10 healthy individuals for
more than 35 years revealed
that reinfection with the
same seasonal coronavirus
occurred frequently at 12
months after infection. This
observation suggests that the
duration of protection
against SARS-CoV-2 reinfec-
tion, too, may not be for
long, and reinfection, which
is a common feature of all
human coronaviruses, might
take place for SARS-CoV-2,
too.

The four common cold co-
ronaviruses belong to two
different genera and use dif-
ferent receptors found on
different host cells that allow
the virus to gain entry and in-
fect the cells.

Key question

With over a dozen cases of
reinfection with SARS-CoV-2,
first reported from Hong
Kong and then from the U.S
and recently from India and

other countries, as con-
firmed through genetic se-
quences, the key question
centres around the duration
of protection following an in-
fection by SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Insights gained from the lon-
gitudinal study published in
Nature Medicine suggest
reinfection with the same
seasonal coronavirus oc-
curred frequently around
one year after previous infec-
tion. The short duration of
protection against seasonal
coronaviruses reinfection
might be applicable for
SARS-CoV-2 virus too.

Caution needed

“We hypothesise that charac-
teristics shared by these four
seasonal coronaviruses, such
as the duration of protective
immunity, are representative
of all human coronaviruses,
including SARS-CoV-2,” the
authors write. The findings
of the study suggest that
“caution may be needed”
when coming up with poli-
cies by relying on long-term
immunity either through
natural infection or vaccina-
tion aimed at attaining herd
immunity.

“I would not be at all sur-
prised to see more reinfec-
tion cases [from SARS-CoV-2]
to be reported in the future,”
Prof. Akiko Iwasaki, an im-
munologist at Yale Universi-
ty, says in an email to The

Hindu. “Since reinfection
can occur, herd immunity by
natural infection is unlikely
to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. The
only safe and effective way to
achieve herd immunity is
through vaccination,” Prof.

Iwasaki tweeted.

For the study, the re-
searchers used serum sam-
ples of adult males who were
monitored at regular inter-
vals since the 1980s to inves-
tigate how often seasonal co-

ronavirus infections
occurred during follow-up.
The authors chose 10 healthy
individuals from the cohort,
and serum samples collected
from them every three
months before 1989 and ev-
ery six months afterwards
were used for the current
study; no samples were col-
lected between 1997 and
2003.

Role of antibodies

The researchers measured
the antibodies to the nucleo-
capsid protein — an abun-
dant coronavirus protein —
for each seasonal coronavi-
rus. An increase in antibo-
dies was considered a new
infection. While reinfections
were seen in a few cases
within six and nine months,
they were more frequent at
12 months. No intermediate
reduction in antibodies bet-
ween infections were seen in
the case of reinfections oc-
curring as early as six
months, but they did ob-
serve intermediate reduc-
tions between infections in
the case of reinfections oc-
curring more than six
months.

Since antibodies induced
by coronavirus infections
might have broad coronavi-
rus-recognising characteris-
tics, they studied the com-
plete nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV-2 to enable detec-
tion of broadly recognising
antibodies.

While two adults showed
broadly recognising antibo-
dies, and antibodies in one
person remained present in
the following years, no evi-
dence of induction and
maintenance of these antibo-
dies were seen. “These sus-
tained broadly recognising
antibodies did not provide
broad protection from subse-
quent infections,” they write.

Strain variation

The researchers were not
able to identify strain varia-
tion among seasonal corona-
viruses that could play a role
in susceptibility to reinfec-
tion. Since there is only
slightly varying circulating
SARS-CoV-2 strains, — in-
creased susceptibility to
reinfection by divergent vi-
rus strains of SARS-CoV-2 is
most likely not the case, they
note.

Viral RNA monitoring of wastewater is useful for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance

R. PRASAD
Analysis of sewage sludge
for a period of 10 weeks in
the New Haven, Connecti-
cut, metropolitan area in
the U.S., during the CO-
VID-19 outbreak period
March 19 to June 1 once
again demonstrates the util-
ity of viral RNA monitoring
of municipal wastewater for
SARS-CoV-2 infection sur-
veillance at a population-
wide level. In this case, the
sewage samples collected
and analysed helped moni-
tor about 200,000 resi-
dents in the metropolitan
area.

Pre-empting records

Analysis of the sludge sam-
ples allowed researchers to
track the rise and fall of pos-
itive cases and hospital ad-
missions days before they
were officially known or re-
corded. Based on the RNA
concentrations in the
sludge, the researchers
were able to know the swing
in cases up to two days be-
fore samples could be col-
lected, one-four days before
hospital admissions and six-
eight days before positive

results were reported. The
results were published in

the journal Nature
Biotechnology.

While the researchers
collected and analysed

primary sewage sludge that
form when raw wastewater
discharges into treatment
facilities, in places that lack
primary wastewater treat-
ment, monitoring of raw
wastewater streams would
be necessary, they write.

Infection dynamics

Based on the results, a team
of researchers led by Dr Jor-
dan Peccia and Dr Saad Om-
er from Yale University,
New Haven, write: “In com-

munities facing a delay bet-
ween specimen collection
and the reporting of test re-
sults, immediate wastewa-
ter results can provide con-
siderable advance notice of
infection dynamics.”

Utility of wastewater

The results come in the
wake of uncertainty and
poor understanding of the
utility of wastewater SARS-
CoV-2 concentrations for
tracking the progression of
COVID-19 infections. This
despite the evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present
in the stools of COVID-19 pa-
tients and hence in sewage,
and of increased RNA con-
centrations in sewage being
correlated with increased
number of cases reported
days later.

Besides delay in seeking a
test and reporting of test re-
sults, symptoms may take a
few days to present once in-
fection sets in. Samples
were collected every day
and the concentration of vi-
ral RNA in the sewage sam-
ples were compared with
publicly available infection
data. They analysed the

numbers and percentages
of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests
by specimen collection
date, the numbers of posi-
tive SARS-CoV-2 tests by re-
porting date, and COVID-19
hospital admissions.

“Sludge results were not
a leading indicator com-
pared to positive test results
or percentage of positive
tests by date of specimen
collection. However, they
led hospitalizations by one-
four days and test results by
report date by about one
week. Thus, in communities
where test reporting is de-
layed, sludge results, if ana-
lysed and reported on the
same day as sampling, can
provide substantial advance
notice of infection dynam-
ics,” they write.

Primary sludge handling
approaches can be different
in treatment plants and this
could affect the levels of de-
tectable virus. “Given the
uncertainties in sludge data
and epidemiological data,
we did not attempt to corre-
late absolute numbers of
sludge SARS-CoV-2. RNA
concentrations and CO-
VID-19 cases,” they note.

Temperatures of cortical and hypothalamus regions rose in sleep-deprived rats

ASWATHI PACHA

The coronavirus pandemic-
induced lockdown has taken
a toll on the sleep cycle of pe-
ople across the globe. Several
online surveys have shown
that social media and un-
structured work-time have al-
tered millennial’s sleep-wake
timings.

Various behavioural and
physiological consequences
of sleep restriction have been
studied and well-document-
ed. A new study shows a di-
rect link between sleep de-
privation and brain and body
temperature in rats.

Role of sleep

The experiments conducted
in the lab revealed that not
sleeping for 24 hours can in-
crease the temperatures of
the cortical and hypothala-
mus brain regions The cere-
bral cortex plays a key role in
attention, awareness and me-
mory; while the hypothala-
mus has various roles: regu-
lating body temperature,
sleep-wake cycle, food in-
take, sexual behaviour, re-
leasing hormones and regu-
lating emotional responses.

 

 

Evidence: Hypothalamic
temperature remained high

Special temperature sen-
sors were implanted into the

10 adult male rats to monitor
all the temperatures simulta-
neously at 15-second inter-
vals.

“We gently rocked the cage
when we saw that the rat was
falling asleep. This gentle
handling method doesn’t in-
duce much stress in the rats.
Taking shifts, my team and I
were able to keep the rats
awake for 24 hours. The rats
had adequate food and water
in the cage, just that we didn't
let them sleep,” explains Lal

=/ OF SCIENCE

 

D. BALASUBRAMANIAN

 

Professor V. Rajaraman, the
doyen of computer science
education and research in In-
dia, has recently written a
book titled: “Groundbreak-
ing Inventions in Informa-
tion and Communication
Technology”, where he dis-
cusses 15 life-altering recent
inventions. I discussed seven
of these in my last article in
The Hindu (dated September
13). Here, we discuss the oth-
er eight.

Replete with detail
Recall the seventh innova-
tion, Computer Graphics. It
has led to the generation and
display of digital data as pic-
tures and movies on a com-
puter’s display. The Graphi-
cal User Interface allows us
to point and click icons on
the display, and for instance,
start a Power Point presenta-
tion. It started with the com-
puter “mouse” which moves
a cursor on the display of a
computer screen. In today’s
hand-held computers, the
mouse is replaced by an ar-
row on the touch screen.
The book is replete with

details of the lives and
achievements of the inven-
tors behind these advances,
and the technical details of
these which are covered as
“Box Items” (and there are
52 Box Items). Reading these
will clearly inspire students
and future innovators.

The next breakthrough is
the development of the In-
ternet, which, clearly, is one
of the greatest inventions of
the 20th century. It has al-
lowed us to communicate
through email, watch You-
Tube presentations and ma-
ny other applications that we
take for granted today.

Two important inventions
led to the development of
the Internet. The first was
breaking up of a long data
stream into smaller packets
before they are transmitted,
invented by Paul Baran and
Donald Davies. The second
was the standardisation of a
protocol called TCP/IP
(Transmission Control Proto-
col/ Internet Protocol) that
allowed inter-connecting a
variety of computer net-
works spread throughout the

world using the existing tele-
phone infrastructure, invent-
ed by Vinton Cerf and Robert
Kahn.

Reaching places

The ninth invention is Global
Positioning System (GPS).
The GPS now can guide us in
finding the best way to reach
from place A to place B. Ear-
lier, sailors looked at the po-
sition of stars in the sky to
detect their own locations
and routes. The discovery of
the magnetic compass was
helpful, and so was the in-
vention of the wireless radio
by Marconi (or JC Bose if you
will). Prof. Rajaraman points
out that when satellites were
launched, it became clear
that signals transmitted from
a set of satellites could deter-
mine the latitude, longitude,
and altitude of an object

anywhere in the world accu-
rately within a few metres. It
was an expensive project
spearheaded by Roger East-
on, Bradford Parkinson and
Ivan Getting and supported
by the U.S. Department of
Defense.

The tenth Innovation is
the World Wide Web (or
WWW), which has made the
Internet infrastructure avail-
able for free. A user can ac-
cess any of the billions of
documents stored in compu-
ters spread across the world.
This was made possible pri-
marily due to the work of
Tim Berners-Lee who de-
signed a protocol called Hy-
perText Transfer Protocol or
HTTP to connect documents
written using a language
called HyperText Markup
Language or HTML. Prof.
Rajaraman points out:

“WWW is thus defined as
content formatted using
HTML stored in computers
connected to the internet
that is accessed using
HTTP”. In order to retrieve
documents from the World
Wide Web using a ‘phrase’
such as the: capitals of the
States in India we need a
software. This is known as a
Search Engine which is the
eleventh Innovation. Google
is one such search engine
that captured the market
due to an innovative search
algorithm invented by Larry
Page and Sergy Brin.

Compressing data

The 12th innovation is Digiti-
sation and Compression of
Multimedia. Digitisation is
essential for processing text,
pictures, audio and video.
When they are digitised they
have enormous number of
bits. This can be compressed
without loss of fidelity in or-
der to be transmitted eco-
nomically. There are many
innovative algorithms to do
this, and these are described
lucidly in the book. The next
innovation is Mobile Com-
puting. Wireless bands re-
served for Industrial, Scien-
tific, and Medical uses were
de-licensed in 1985 by go-
vernments and allowed to be
used for communication of
data. This permitted porta-
ble laptops to be connected
wirelessly to a LAN. The pro-
tocol for wireless communi-

cation was standardised and
led to WiFi. The ensuing In-
ternet access leads us to ap-
plications such as WhatsApp.
The emergence of 3G and 4G
mobile infrastructure result-
ed in smart phones.

In the Cloud
The 14th innovation is Cloud
Computing. Excess comput-
ing power available with
companies such as Amazon
and Google that maintain
huge computing infrastruc-
ture for running their busi-
nesses was offered to any
one “on demand” and
charged based on use. This
became feasible with the ad-
vent of Internet and decreas-
ing cost of communication.

The fifteenth innovation is
Deep Learning. McCulloch, a
neurologist and Pitts a math-
ematical genius modelled
the human brain as a collec-
tion of interconnected neu-
rons. This was simulated as a
multi-layered neural net-
work by Geoffrey Hinton and
David Rumelhart on a com-
puter. This model could be
made to learn to recognise
faces and speech by exten-
sive training using enormous
data. This is an aspect of AI
that will be used in many fu-
ture systems such as driver-
less cars.

the paper recently published
in the Journal of Sleep Re-
search.

After 24 hours, they were
given a recovery sleep of 12
hours. Body and brain tem-
peratures recorded during
baseline conditions, sleep de-
privation period and recov-
ery sleep were then analysed.

During the sleep depriva-
tion period the temperature
of the body, hypothalamic
and cortical region was found
to increase significantly. The
recovery sleep was able to
bring down the body and cor-
tical temperature to the near-
baseline value in about four
hours. However, the hypotha-
lamic temperature remained
higher than the baseline va-
lues throughout the 12 hours
of recovery sleep. This may
be due to the fact that hy-
pothalamus is the tempera-
ture regulating area of the
brain.

“We propose that this rise
in temperature may have an
effect on cognitive ability.
Acute sleep deprivation has

also been reported to affect
the mood, memory skills and
attention in humans. Many
times, we catch ourselves
making an error in judge-
ment when we don’t get
proper sleep,” adds Hruda
Nanda Mallick from the De-
partment of Physiology, All
India Institute of Medical
Sciences, New Delhi. He is
the corresponding author of
the work.

Neuromuscular changes
The team is currently study-
ing the impact of sleep de-
privation on neuromuscular
changes to prove the point
that muscles are also a benef-
iciary of sleep.

Dr Mallick adds: “Sleep is
as important as nutrition and
exercise. Although the core
function of sleep is yet to be
discovered, it serves many
important functions which
include, growth and repair,
memory consolidation, ener-
gy conservation and boost
immunity. I urge people to
follow a strict sleep routine
and to immediately consult a
doctor if they have a problem
falling asleep.”

 

Rusty Moon
Is the Moon rusting?

On September 6, Union
Minister Jitendra Singh
said that images sent by
Chandrayaan-l suggest
that the moon may be
rusting along the poles.
He was referring to a
recently published study
that found an oxidised
iron mineral
called
hematite
(Fe20s) at high
latitudes on
the Moon.
The
researchers
say that this
lunar hematite
is formed through
oxidation of the iron on
the Moon's surface by
the oxygen from Earth's
upper atmosphere. The
team analysed the data
acquired by the Moon
Mineralogy Mapper
onboard Chandrayaan-1.
“More hematite on the
lunar nearside suggested
that it may be related to
Earth,” said lead author
Dr Shuai Li at the
Hawaii’s Institute of
Geophysics and
Planetology (HIGP) in the

 

 

UH Manoa School of
Ocean and Earth Science
and Technology (SOEST)
ina release. Along with
the oxygen, water on the
lunar surface and heat
from interplanetary dust
also helped in the
oxidation process. The
paper in Science
Advances notes that the
hematite is not absolutely
absent on the lunar
farside. There, a small
amount of iron oxides
“might be formed under
the presence of water and
energies induced by
interplanetary dust
impacts and then be
decomposed to
hematite.” They write
that the
hematite formed
at lunar craters
of different ages
may help
understand the
oxygen of
Earth’s
atmosphere in
the past 2.4
billion years and reveal
facts about the evolution
of Earth’s atmosphere in
the past billions of years.
The team hopes that
NASA's ARTEMIS
missions can bring some
hematite samples, and
detailed chemical studies
can confirm if the lunar
hematite was indeed
oxidised by Earth’s

oxygen.

Life markers on Venus

What does the detected presence
of phosphine mean? Why are
astronomers excited?

SHUBASHREE DESIKAN

 

The story so far: An international team of astronomers
led by Jane S. Greaves of Cardiff University and
University of Cambridge, U-K., has announced the
discovery of traces of a molecule known as phosphine on
Venus. This has caused great excitement because, given
the chemical and geological composition of Venus, this
can imply the existence of life forms that release this
substance through bio-chemical pathways.

The researchers say in the paper, “[Phosphine] could
originate from unknown photochemistry or
geochemistry, or, by analogy with biological production
of [phosphine] on Earth, from the presence of life.” The
paper, published on September 14 in Nature Astronomy,
is a careful exposition of the work done over many years.
Professor Greaves first observed phosphine on Venus
using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in the Mauna
Kea observatory in Hawaii in 2017. Pursuing the search
further with the 45-telescope array ALMA (Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) in Chile led to a
confirmation of their observations by this extremely
sensitive instrument in 2019.

Have astronomers found definite signs of life?

The detected presence of phosphine on Venus does
convey the possibility of life there. After detecting the
phosphine and estimating the amount in Venus’s
atmosphere — 20 parts per
billion — researchers have
calculated whether this
amount of phosphine can
be produced by natural
chemical processes, such
as sunlight, volcanoes
erupting and lightning.
The other mechanisms
could at most produce
only ten-thousandth of the
amount of phosphine they
have detected. However,
they do not rule out the
possibility that there could
be unknown natural processes (photochemistry or
geochemistry) that can produce this amount of the
biomarker. Therefore, more work is needed to prove that
it is indeed because of bacteria, or some sort of life, that
there is so much phosphine on Venus.

The temperature of
Venus, at about 470
degrees Celsius, is too
hot to harbour life as
we know it. The
phosphine signature
could be the sign of
some extraordinary
chemistry, according
to experts

a

Why is phosphine gas considered

a biomarker of life?

A molecule of phosphine gas consists of a phosphorus
atom surrounded by three hydrogen atoms, just like
ammonia consists of a nitrogen atom surrounded by
three hydrogen atoms. On Earth, this molecule is
produced by industrial processes. It is also produced by
some anaerobic bacteria, which live in oxygen-sparse
environments such as sewers, landfills, or even animal
guts. If you can rule out the production of the gas
through chemistry, it is the biochemical processes that
form a source of the gas — the anaerobic bacteria —
hence it is considered a biomarker in astronomy.

Has phosphine been found on other planets?

Yes, it has been seen on Jupiter and Saturn. As early as
the 1970s, when the first exoplanets were not even
discovered experimentally, phosphine was seen on
Jupiter. But there it is said to form deep in the interiors of
the gas giant and rise to the top, in a purely chemical
process. But now, on Venus there is a doubt.

Venus is considered to be a hostile planet.

How can life survive there?

The surface temperature of Venus, at about 470 degrees
Celsius, is too hot to harbour life as we know it. It is hot
enough to melt lead. It is hotter than Mercury which is
closest to the sun. According to a senior astronomer who
is amember of the Astronomical Society of India, this is
because Venus has experienced a runaway greenhouse
effect which traps all heat that falls on it. But high up in
its atmosphere, there are clouds which can provide a
cooler home for microbial life. Even there, the
atmosphere is teeming with sulphuric acid vapour which
makes it extremely hostile, thereby reducing the chance
of finding life forms. According to the expert, the
phosphine signature could be the sign of some
extraordinary chemistry, as it could be of life forms. The
next logical step is to actually do in sits measurements
from Venus’s atmosphere by sending space probes there.

Have space missions been sent to Venus?

There have been several space missions to study Venus,
and some of the recent dedicated missions are the
European Space Agency’s Venus Express and JAXA’s
Akatsuki. Many space missions have flown by Venus: for
example, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe used the gravity of
Venus to achieve gravity-assisted boosts to its velocity on
its journey to the Sun. NASA is planning a mission to
Venus to be launched next year. The Indian Venus
mission is being developed. Though formally unnamed,
it is referred to as Shukrayaan-1.

What are the agreements that govern
India and China's actions? Why is
the troops build-up significant?

DINAKAR PERI

The story so far: On Tuesday, Defence Minister Rajnath
Singh told Parliament that China had mobilised a large
number of troops and armaments along the Line of
Actual Control (LAC) with several friction areas in Eastern
Ladakh including the north and south banks of Pangong
Tso (lake). He said the amassing of troops went against
the bilateral agreements of 1993 and 1996.

Why are there different perceptions?

Mr. Singh said there had been situations of prolonged
stand-offs in the border areas with China in the past
which had been resolved peacefully. He said the situation
this year “is very different both in terms of scale of troops
involved and the number of friction points...” This
underscores the magnitude of the current situation along
the disputed boundary in Eastern Ladakh. There is no
commonly delineated LAC and Mr. Singh said India and
China have different perceptions about the LAC. This has
led to periodic tensions and the number of transgressions
and face-offs went up as India’s border infrastructure
improved and Indian Army patrols to the claim areas
increased over the years. A series of boundary
agreements have been signed and confidence-building
measures (CBMs) carried out to maintain peace and
tranquillity while the two sides attempted to delineate
the boundary through Special Representatives.

What happens when agreements are flouted?
While the agreements remain in place, the recent massive
mobilisation of troops, tanks, armoured carriers and air
defences very close to the LAC is in violation of the terms.
Since the Galwan Valley clash on June 15, the Army has
empowered its local commanders to take appropriate
action as situations unfold and recently shots have been
fired in the air, the first on the LAC since 1975. Thousands
of troops and armaments continue to be deployed in
close proximity, in some places within a few hundred
metres of each other, so the chances of an accidental or
inadvertent escalation which can spiral into a major
confrontation remain high. Mr. Singh said that in
response to “China’s actions, our armed forces have also
made appropriate counter-deployments in these areas to
ensure that India’s borders are fully protected”.

What do the border agreements say?
A key element of both the 1993 and 1996 agreements is

that the two sides would keep their forces in the areas
along the LAC to a minimum level, Mr. Singh stated.
However, the agreements do not define what comprises
the minimum level. The 1996 agreement limits the
deployment of major categories of armaments close to
the LAC, including tanks, infantry combat vehicles, guns
with 75-mm or bigger calibre, mortars with 120-mm or

A key element of both
the 1993 and 1996
agreements is that the
two sides would keep
their military forces
along the LAC toa
minimum. But they do
not specify what
comprises a minimum
level

above and various
missiles. It also limits
combat aircraft from
flying within 10 km of the
LAC. It stipulates that
neither side “shall open
fire, cause bio-
degradation, use
hazardous chemicals,
conduct blast operations
or hunt with guns or
explosives within two
km” from the LAC.

Use of firearms on the
LAC is strictly regulated
as per the agreements of
1993, 1996 and 2005. The 1993 and 1996 agreements also
mandate that pending a final solution to the boundary
question, the two sides shall strictly respect the LAC.
Further in these agreements, India and China committed
themselves to clarification and confirmation of the LAC to
reach a common understanding of the alignment.
However, this process has made little progress since
2003. Both sides have so far exchanged maps only in the

 

central sector, leading to overlapping claims at several
points due to “differences in perception”.

How should troops deal with face-offs?

In 2012, India and China agreed to establish a Working
Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination to “study
ways and means to conduct and strengthen exchanges
and cooperation between military personnel and
establishments...in the border areas.” The 2013 Border
Defence Cooperation Agreement lists several
mechanisms to reduce misunderstandings and improve
communication. Article VI of the agreement prohibits
either side from tailing the patrols of the other “in areas
where there is no common understanding of the line of
actual control”.

What is the way forward?

Since the Galwan clash there have been calls for a review
of the agreements from various quarters. Following the
recent flare-up in tensions on the north and south banks
of Pangong Tso, at recent meetings between the Defence
and Foreign Ministers of the two countries in Moscow,
both sides agreed that they shall abide by all the existing
boundary agreements, maintain peace and tranquillity in
the border areas and “avoid any action that could
escalate matters”. The five-point plan agreed between
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10
states that “as the situation eases, the two sides should
expedite work to conclude new CBMs to maintain and
enhance peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.

What are the long-term effects of COVID-19?

Why are some patients who had mild symptoms and have recovered now suffering from other serious concerns?

RAMYA KANNAN

The story so far: Surviving COVID-19 has been only part
of the triumph for some patients. While doctors were well
aware of the impact of lasting viral infections, the first few
months of the pandemic were devoted to preventing trans-
mission and figuring out how to take care of those in hospi-
tals, and not much attention was paid to the after-effects.
But over eight months into the epidemic, these can no lon-
ger be ignored. Though SARS-CoV-2 is essentially a virus
that hits the lungs, in a smaller subset, it also seems to have
an impact on the lungs, heart and brain, increasing the
risk of long-term health issues, and life-threatening com-
plications.

What kinds of complications may occur?

Gregory Poland, of the Vaccine Research Group, Mayo
Clinic, U.S., says: “This is a disease that has a number of
mysteries involved, compared to the usual respiratory vi-
rus... there is diminution of immunity, long-term fatigue,
headaches, vertigo, difficulty with cognition, and cardio-
respiratory fitness. But a large portion of that is likely to re-
late to the significant cellular level damage this disease can
cause... This can be a really wicked virus in some people.”

Among the more common lingering symptoms are fa-
tigue, cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle and
joint pain. In Chennai, doctors who had recovered from
COVID-19 to return to work complained of chronic fatigue,
besides myalgia (muscle pain) and weakness.

The Mayo Clinic lists organs that may be affected by CO-
VID-19: Heart: imaging tests taken months after recovery
show lasting damage to the heart muscle, even in those
with only mild symptoms, increasing the risk of heart fai-
lure or other heart complications; Lungs: long-standing
damage to the air sacs inside the lungs, leading to long-

 

"AFP

term breathing problems; Brain: strokes, seizures and
Guillain-Barre syndrome that causes temporary paralysis.
An increased risk of developing Parkinson’s and Alzheim-
er’s disease is possible; Blood: blood cells are more likely
to clump up and form clots. While large clots can cause
heart attacks and strokes, much of the heart damage
caused by COVID-19 is believed to stem from very small
clots that block capillaries in the heart muscle. Blood
throwing such clots can affect other organs as well — the
lungs, legs, liver, kidneys; Mood disorders: simply surviv-
ing this experience can make a person more likely to later
develop post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and an-
xiety.

Does everyone face these side effects?

The good news, according to the Mayo Clinic, is that most
people who have the novel coronavirus disease recover
completely within a few weeks. Only some people, includ-
ing even those who had mild versions of the disease, conti-
nue to experience symptoms after their initial recovery.
Even people who tested positive but were asymptomatic
during the course of their disease are not immune either

from long-term effects. In a letter published in Nature
Medicine in June, researchers from China explained that
CT scans done in asymptomatic people revealed abnormal
radiological findings in one lung in 66.7% of the asympto-
matic people and abnormalities in both lungs in 33.3% of
them. While it is said that senior citizens and people with
co-morbidities are more likely to suffer long-term effects,
even children and the young who had milder versions of
the disease are reporting
persistent symptoms. The
WHO mentions a telephone
survey of symptomatic
adults who had a positive
outpatient test result for
SARS-CoV-2: 35% had not re-
turned to their usual state of
health when interviewed
2-3 weeks after testing.
Among those 18-34 years in
good health, 20% reported
that some symptoms were
prolonged.

The Mayo Clinic, U.S.,
listed organs that may
be affected by
COVID-19 including
the heart, lungs and
brain. In Chennai,
doctors who had
recovered complained
of chronic fatigue,
besides myalgia and
weakness

as What are the solutions?

Countries across the world
are beginning to realise the importance of assessing the
long-term impact, and exploring solutions to rectify dam-
age. The U.K’s PHOSP(post-hospitalisation)-COVID project
is one of several such projects globally to study patients
who have been hospitalised with COVID-19. Over the
course of a year, clinical assessments will track 10,000 pa-
tients to gain a comprehensive picture of the impact CO-
VID-19 has had on longer-term health outcomes. The team
will then develop trials of new strategies for clinical care to
improve long-term health.

Sputnik V and the long road to a vaccine

What do the Russian trials tell us? How will the tie-up with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories help India?

JACOB KOSHY

The story so far: On September 16, Hyderabad-based
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories announced that it had signed an
agreement with the Russian Direct Investment Fund
(RDIF) to conduct large human trials (Phase-3) of Sputnik
V. A candidate vaccine for COVID-19, it has been
developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and
piloted by the RDIF, the country’s sovereign wealth fund.
If these trials are successful and the vaccine is proved to
be safe, Russia has committed itself to supplying 100
million doses to India through Dr. Reddy’s.

What do we know about Sputnik V?
Much like the launch of the Sputnik-1 satellite in 1957
heralded the Space Age, Russia claims the vaccine
candidate will “reinvigorate” vaccine development and a
potential solution to the coronavirus pandemic. Sputnik
V is being developed as a two-dose vaccine
using two human recombinant

adenovirus vectors — rAd5 and rAd26 —
known to cause respiratory infections.
These vectors have been modified to not
replicate in the body. These inactivated
vectors are also tweaked to carry the ‘S
gene’ that encodes the ‘spike protein’ of
the coronavirus. The hope is that these
vectors will inveigle themselves into a
small number of the body’s cells, trick

the body into registering the

coronavirus’ spike protein and thus
activate the immune system into

   

producing specialised ‘T’ cells that can neutralise the
affected cells. Once this happens the immune system is
expected to produce antibodies as well as ‘memory B
cells’, which can produce the right offensive cells when
needed to neutralise future SARS-CoV-2 infections the
body may encounter.

Is this a proven approach?
There have been several experimental vaccines and drugs
that use human adenovirus vectors but none has been
commercially approved for use in people. Sputnik V is
also a two-dose regimen, meaning that individual shots
are dispensed three weeks apart. The argument is that
the second dose acts as a booster shot and Gamaleya has
said the use of two vectors is what differentiates the
Russian vaccine from the other adenovirus-based
approaches. CanSino Biologics of China and the vaccine
being developed by Oxford University (ChAdOx!) are also
based on adenovirus platforms, except that the
Oxford candidate uses an adenovirus vector

Bz \ that is known to infect chimpanzees.

th

What are the key challenges?
The challenge with using human adenoviruses
is that because they commonly infect people,
many have pre-existing immunity to the virus
and so antibodies may block the vector even
before it infiltrates cells and synthesises
proteins that can specifically induce
immune cells specific to the
coronavirus. The rAd5 has been
=AP

previously used to produce vaccines as well as drugs
against other diseases including HIV, but that didn’t work.
CanSino Biologics used the same vector to make a vaccine
against the Ebola virus during an outbreak in West Africa.
The vaccine was tested in people but wasn’t licensed,
though it reportedly induced a short-term antibody
response in those who were inoculated. Researchers
suggested that the pre-existing rAd5 immunity in people
may have blunted the response. An adenovirus-based
vaccine has been commercially licensed for rabies. The
second vector being used by Sputnik V, rAd26, is a rarer
adenovirus and is devised to work as a backup or a
booster to stimulate a stronger response. The risks are
that too strong a response may cause severe adverse
reactions.

Has Russia started large trials of Sputnik V?
Earlier this month, Russia said it had begun testing the
vaccine in the country among 40,000 volunteers as part
of its large Phase-3 trials. Experience from Phase-1 and
Phase-2 in a smaller group of volunteers and designed to
test for safety and efficacy suggested that it was promising
enough to progress onto the larger trials. The most
controversial aspect of Sputnik V is that it has already
been preapproved by the country’s health agency even
before Phase-1 and 2 trial results were published.
According to health experts, this indicated that speed,
and not safety, was being prioritised. Pharmaceutical
companies in the U.S. and Europe have pledged not to
approach regulators before Phase-3 trials concluded. As
of Saturday, there were no details of how Dr. Reddy’s
planned to go about conducting the trials in India.

STANLY JOHNY

Taliban, who had taken

southern Afghanistan un-
der their control, organised a
conference of their fighters,
commanders and mullahs in
downtown Kandahar. The ci-
ty hosts one of the holiest
shrines in the country —-The
Shrine of the Cloak of the
Prophet Mohammed, which
keeps a robe that Afghans be-
lieve was worn by the Pro-
phet. Very rarely has it been
shown to the public. Those
who had assembled before
an old mosque in central
Kandahar were clueless what
they were going to see. Then
Mullah Mohammed Omar
appeared on its roof, with
the cloak in his hands. He
held it aloft before the cheer-
ing crowd, who named him
‘Amir ul-Momineen’, the
commander of the faithful.

Omar appeared with the
relic at a critical juncture of
the Taliban’s history. The
militants had not reached
Kabul yet. The rank and file
were divided on whether the
Taliban, consisting of mainly
madrassa students, should
take the war to the capital.
But what happened in Kan-
dahar, as Steve Coll wrote in
his profile of the Taliban
leader in The New Yorker,
was Omar’s “coronation” as
the leader of the most power-
ful insurgency in the coun-
try. The Taliban would cap-
ture Kabul within a few
months and establish the Is-
lamic Emirate of
Afghanistan.

Omar would rule most of
the country for the next five
years. Overthrown by the
U.S. in 2001 following the
September 11 terrorist at-
tacks, the Taliban would re-

[: the spring of 1996, the

treat to the mountainous hin-
terlands of Afghanistan,
while their leadership
crossed the border to Pakis-
tan. The war continued, kill-
ing hundreds of thousands of
people, and wounding and
displacing many more. Al-
most 20 years after they lost
Kabul, the Taliban are now
controlling almost half of the

 

Pakistan, rattled by
India’s growing
influence in post-
Taliban Afghanistan,
played a double game
— it joined the U.S.-led
war on terror, while
at the same time
helping the Taliban

country. Earlier this year,
they reached an agreement
with the U.S. as part of which
American and other interna-
tional troops would with-
draw from Afghanistan in re-
turn for the Taliban’s
assurance that they won't let
foreign terrorists use Afghan
soil. As part of the broader
peace process, Taliban re-
presentatives and the Afghan
government opened formal
talks earlier this month in
the Qatari capital Doha
where both sides would be
seeking to build a consensus
on how a post-American Af-
ghanistan should be.

Civil war

The roots of the Taliban go
back to the Mujahideen
movement against the Soviet
troops in Afghanistan in the
1980s. Many of the Taliban’s
early leadership, including
Omar, fought the Soviets
with various Mujahideen fac-

tions, which were supported
by the Central Intelligence
Agency, Pakistan’s Inter Ser-
vice Intelligence and Saudi
Arabia. After the Soviets
pulled back in 1989, the Mu-
jahideen groups _ started
fighting each other, plunging
the country into a civil war.

The post-communist Af-
ghanistan was divided along
the ethnic lines. There was
no central authority. Life was
chaotic. Crimes were ram-
pant. Afghanistan, which the
poet Mohammed Iqbal
called “the heart of Asia”,
was falling apart. It was
against this background a
group of madrassa students
(Talibs), with roots in Deo-
bandi seminaries and sup-
port from different Deobandi
factions in Pakistan, came to-
gether to launch a new “re-
form” movement. Predomi-
nantly Pashtun, their
declared goals were: esta-
blish order, restore peace,
disarm the militias, enforce
the Sharia code and unite pe-
ople under (their version of)
Islam. They chose Omar, a
young, locally influential
preacher who lost one eye in
the battle against the Red Ar-
my, as their leader.

There are lots of stories
about how Omar mobilised
the Talibs under his com-
mand. “The most credible
story”, writes Anmed Rashid
in his book, Taliban, “is that
in the spring of 1994, Singe-
sar neighbours came to tell
him that a commander had
abducted two teenage girls.”
They were taken to a military
camp and repeatedly raped.
Omar attacked the base with
some 30 Talibs, freed the
girls and hanged the com-
mander from the barrel of a
tank. From the base, they
captured arms and ammuni-

tion, beginning a long jour-
ney of bloody militancy.

The Taliban swept up mil-
itary victories with the help
of the ISI. Pakistan found the
Taliban the most reassuring
proxy in an otherwise frac-
tured Afghanistan. After cap-
turing Kabul, the Taliban en-
forced their version of strict
Islamist code. It destroyed
movie theatres, banned wo-
men from working in public
offices, kept girls out of
schools and banned public

music, the sale of CDs and
even kite flying. Kabul’s
sports stadium was turned
into a public execution
ground. In March 2001, the
Taliban blew up the two
giant stone statues of the
Buddha in Bamiyan.

After the 9/11 terrorist at-
tacks on the U.S., Omar faced
a difficult choice. Osama bin
Laden, the al-Qaeda leader,
planned and executed the at-
tack from Afghanistan. The
U.S. asked the Taliban to

ILLUSTRATION: R. RAJESH

 

hand over bin Laden. Omar
refused, which was followed
by the U.S. invasion and the
ouster of the Taliban from
power. Since then, the Tali-
ban have been fighting to re-
capture what they lost — ‘the
Islamic Emirate of
Afghanistan’.

Fight and talk

In 2015, the Taliban an-
nounced that Mullah Omar
died two years earlier in Pa-
kistan. Mullah Mansour, who

succeeded Omar, was killed
in a US. air strike in 2015.
Since 2016, the less-known
Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhund-
zada has been the group’s
leader. Under Akhundzada,
the Taliban have taken a
‘fight and talk’ approach. In
2018, U.S. officials and Tali-
ban representatives held
their first meeting in Doha,
where the insurgents had
opened a political office.
Throughout talks with the
U.S., the Taliban refused to
agree to a lasting ceasefire.

Pakistan played a key role
in the Taliban’s resurgence.
Rattled by India’s growing in-
fluence in post-Taliban Af
ghanistan, Pakistan played a
double game — it joined the
U.S.-led war on terror, while
at the same time secretly
helping the Taliban. As Steve
Coll writes in his book Direc-
torate S, the ISI set up a se-
cret unit called ‘Directorate
S’ to handle its Taliban oper-
ations and worked from an
Army camp in Ojhri, near
Rawalpindi.

Now, the war has entered
into a stalemate. The Afghan
government cannot defeat
the Taliban and the Taliban
seem unable, for now, to
seize the major population
centres, including Kabul.
This, coupled with the U.S’s
desire to get out of the war,
prompted the peace talks.
But hard questions remain.
With the U.S. agreeing to pull
back, the Taliban have met
one of their key goals. But
they haven’t recognised the
Afghan Constitution. There
is no truce yet. It’s not clear
what would their eventual
goal be.

“There are some diffe-
rences between the Taliban
of the 1990s and today’s Tali-
ban. We now have the se-
cond generation Taliban.
Their links with the military
and religious establishment
in Pakistan are different.
Their working relationship
with terrorist outfits like Al-
Qaeda are limited today,”
said D. Suba Chandran, a
Professor of strategic and se-
curity studies at the National
Institute of Advanced Stu-
dies, Bangalore. “But their
core ideology hasn't
changed. If they were not
ready to share power then,
they won’t do it now. I don't
think their approach towards
liberal institutions, minori-
ties, women and_ other
groups has changed either.”

mong the few defini-
At things that can be

said about Japan’s
new Prime Minister, Yoshi-
hide Suga, is that he does
not wear his heart on his
sleeve. As the right-hand
man of his predecessor,
Shinzo Abe, Mr. Suga has
fielded questions from the
press on an almost-daily ba-
sis for years. And yet, des-
pite his public role, he has
revealed little about himself
other than gnomic nuggets
like his penchant for pan-
cakes and fishing. But alth-
ough his inner world re-
mains enigmatic, his skill at
deflection, capacity for hard
work and unwavering loyal-
ty towards Mr. Abe have
proved enough to propel
him to the helm of the
nation.

Mr. Suga’s journey to the
political summit has been
up a very different road to
that of his mentor’s. While
Mr. Abe’s lineage was so ro-
bust as to endow his rise al-
most with a sense of inevita-
bility (both his maternal
grandfather and great uncle
were former PMs), the 71-
year-old Mr. Suga is a self-
made man. The son of a
strawberry farmer, he was
born in the snow-covered
hardscrabble of rural Akita
province, in Japan’s north.
To put himself through un-
iversity in Tokyo, he worked
a series of odd jobs — includ-
ing at a cardboard factory
and a fish market. Hiroshi
Kawai, a high school class-
mate told the New York
Times: “We have such pro-

M
K

verbs as ‘great talents are
slow to mature’ and ‘a wise
falcon hides its talons’ Now,
I realized that those words
were created for Mr. Suga.”

Entry into politics
After graduating, Mr. Suga
joined an electrical mainte-
nance company, but soon
quit the life of a salaryman
to become the secretary to a
Parliamentarian. More than
a decade on, he won a seat
on the port of Yokohama’s
city assembly, but it was on-
ly in 1996 that he made a
breakthrough into national
politics, getting elected to
the House of Representa-
tives on a Liberal Democrat-
ic Party ticket. His most as-
tute move was to hitch his
lot to the destined star of the
political firmament Shinzo
Abe. During both Mr. Abe’s
terms as Prime Minister Mr.
Suga was at his side, ma-
noeuvring behind the
scenes, executing policy,
and helping to bring unwiel-
dy bureaucrats into line.

He emerged as the yin to

ILLUSTRATION: J.A. PREMKUMAR

 

his boss’s yang. Where Mr.
Abe was charismatic, Mr.
Suga was self-effacing, even
dour. Mr. Abe operated in
the spotlight; Mr. Suga was
comfortable in the shadows.
Mr. Abe had a clear, Gf un-
achieved) vision for his
country. Mr. Suga eschewed
grand visions for practical
goals. But what he lacked in
oomph, he made up for in
steely resolve. His daily regi-
men for the last eight years
is a window into this tenaci-
ty. Mr. Suga is known to
have woken every morning
at 5:00 am to take a 40-mi-
nute walk, followed by a 100
sit-ups. He was at the office
by 9:00 am and took up two
dozen meetings a day, in ad-
dition to addressing press
conferences. He preferred
to eat soba noodles for
lunch, which are easily
slurped, to cut down on the
time spent eating. For a
nightcap, (Mr. Suga is a tee-
totaler), he completed
another 100 sit-ups.

His achievements as Mr.
Abe’s chief Cabinet Secre-

tary included getting tele-
communication companies
to drop expensive mobile
phone fees and opening the
borders to greater numbers
of foreign workers.

But as Prime Minister, Mr.
Suga will need to lead rather
than implement, his career
specialty thus far. He has
promised continuity and
stability, and most analysts
do not expect him to signifi-
cantly break with Mr. Abe’s
policies. But the formidable
challenges facing Japan
need fresh ideas. Mr. Suga
takes over at a time when
the administration’s han-
dling of the COVID-19 pan-
demic is widely seen as con-
fused and the Japanese
economy is in serious trou-
ble; all this against the back-
drop of an ageing demo-
graphic and unpredictable
geo-strategic environment
given an assertive China,
bellicose North Korea and
unpredictable U.S.

It is unclear whether Mr.
Suga will choose to ride out
the rest of what would have
been Mr. Abe’s term until
next year, or go to the polls
sooner to win a popular
mandate. In the absence of
an election, it is unlikely
that he will rock the boat
with any bold policy depar-
tures. What is less predicta-
ble is Mr. Suga’s ultimate
fate in the history books:
will he join the blur of for-
gettable short-lived Prime
Ministers that have been a
standard feature of the Japa-
nese political landscape, or
will he emerge as a falcon
whose talons prove sharp
enough to leave their mark?

Ss. ANANDAN

the Koran should give

KT. Jaleel, Kerala’s Minis-
ter of Higher Education and
Welfare of Minorities who
swears by the holy text, the
biggest test of his political
life. The Customs Depart-
ment suspects an unholy
nexus between the Minister
and some officials of the
Consulate of the UAE in Ker-
ala’s capital, Thiruvanan-
thapuram, in “fraudulently
importing goods, including
a recent consignment of 250
cartons of the sacred text
weighing about 4.5 tonnes
into the State” using the di-
plomatic route claiming du-
ty exemption.

The Customs probe is just
the latest in the trail of dis-
quieting developments for
Mr. Jaleel in the past fort-
night, on the heels of his
questioning by the Enforce-
ment Directorate (ED) and
the National Investigation
Agency (NIA) in a related
case of gold smuggling using
the Consulate as cover. A
key accused in that case had
worked with the Consulate,
maintained high-level con-
nections in the government
and interacted with the Mi-
nister, who is also in charge
of the Wakf Department.

Following his questioning
by the ED, the Minister
maintained that accepting
the Koran from the UAE dur-
ing the month of Ramzan
was part of a ‘cultural and
religious’ custom. The Op-
position, especially the In-
dian Union Muslim League
(UML), has launched prot-

[« ironic that copies of

ests, calling for his resigna-
tion. However, the Commu-
nist Party of India (Marxist),
which heads the ruling coa-
lition, threw its weight be-
hind the Minister, reading
the whole episode as one
against the Koran.

Break with League
Mr. Jaleel is not a member of
the CPI(M). But he has en-
joyed the confidence of
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vi-
jayan from the time he was
fielded by the Left as an In-
dependent candidate in the
Kuttippuram constituency
in Malappuram in 2006. It
was a year after his ouster,
following differences with
the leadership, from the
youth wing of the IUML in
which he had functioned as
state general secretary. He
emerged as a giant killer by
trouncing the League
strongman, P.K. Kunhalikut-
ty, in what used to be a
League bastion until then.

A native of Tirur in Malap-
puram, he was drawn to the

of India (SIMD in the late
1980s. After severing ties
with SIMI, he joined the
Muslim Students Federa-
tion, the students’ wing of
the TUML, while studying
history at PSMO College in
Tirurangadi, Malappuram.
He went on to become a lec-
turer in the same college
and his clout within the
Youth League grew under
the patronage of Korambayil
Ahammed Haji, known for
his progressive stances.

An abiding interest in his-
tory earned him a Ph.D.
from the University of Kera-
la and his work, a rereading
of the role of Variamkun-
nath Kunhamed Haji and Ali
Musliyar in what came to be
known as the Malabar Re-
bellion of 1921, was later pu-
blished as a book, the se-
cond authored by him, with
a forward by Pinarayi Vi-
jayan. The book, which cap-
tures the contours of the
agrarian uprising in the con-
text of the anti-colonial
strife, is in its seventh edi-

tion now.

 

When Mr. Vijayan, then
State secretary of the CPI
(M), took out a pre-election
march along the length of
Kerala in 2009, Mr. Jaleel
marched alongside as the
only non-party member of
its core team of senior CPI
(M) leaders. In the elections
of 2011 and 2016, he kept the
faith reposed in him by win-
ning the Thavanur consti-
tuency as a Left-backed In-
dependent.

It, therefore, surprised
no one when he was select-
ed to the Cabinet led by Mr.
Vijayan in 2016 as Minister
in charge of Local Self-go-
vernments. However, in
2018, he came under a cloud
following allegations of ne-
potism after his kin, K-T.
Adeeb, was appointed gen-
eral manager in the Kerala
State Minorities Develop-
ment Corporation. Mr.
Adeeb eventually quit the
post. Mr. Jaleel put up a
brave face when his name
cropped up in connection
with a well-networked ac-
cused in the gold scam in
August this year, saying he
was ready to face any inqui-
ry. But he soon became res-
tive in the face of adverse
media coverage and as Cen-
tral agencies began to call
him for questioning, turned
selective in talking to the
media, his assertion of
“truth alone will prevail”
notwithstanding.

The Assembly elections
are less than a year away,
and the Left, viewing the de-
velopments as political, is
unlikely to isolate him. But
the heat, for the moment, is
definitely on Mr. Jaleel.

dium and only four pitches
to be used — five or more
matches will be played on
one pitch— so I think we can
expect the conditions to
change quite a bit," said
Ricky Ponting at Saturday’s
virtual media conference,
ahead of Delhi Capitals’
campaign-opener against
Kings XI Punjab in Dubai on
Sunday.

 

Bigger roles

Seamers would have an im-
pact in the early stages and
spinners as the season pro-
gresses, said the Capitals
coach.

Delhi will, hence, eye a
better second half, with leg-
spinner Amit Mishra — the
most successful spinner in
the IPL — and off-spinner R.
Ashwin playing bigger roles.

Ponting said his team
would be hard to beat. "It’s
been a long lead-up to this
first game, but I’m looking
forward to the challenge, as
I’m sure all the players also

Two greats, Ricky Ponting
and Anil Kumble, will match
wits as Shreyas Iyer and K.L.
Rahul marshal their resourc-

ween Delhi Capitals and
Kings XI Punjab here on
Sunday.

Delhi Capitals has a slight
edge, more so in the spin de-
partment, with the trio of R.
Ashwin, Amit Mishra and Ax-
ar Patel, better than their
counterparts from the Moha-
li-based side. Spin is expect-
ed to play a big role on the
pitches in the UAE.

On the batting front, the
Capitals have India interna-
tionals Prithvi Shaw,
Shreyas, Rishabh Pant, Shik-
har Dhawan, besides West
Indian Shimron Hetmyer.

Clean hitters
The KXIP also boasts of
some of the cleanest hitters
in the form of Chris Gayle,

has a dangerous opening

World Cup-winning coach thinks
there could be a new champion

P.K. AJITH KUMAR

G Kirsten believes the
current edition of the
IPL, which opened at Abu
Dhabi on Saturday, could be
the most open one ever.

“The difference in this
year’s IPL is that there are
no crowds and no home
games and I think that is a
massive neutraliser’ said
the former South African
opener who was the coach
when India when the World
Cup in 2011. He was speak-
ing in a webinar organised
by Hyderabad Runners, a
not-for-profit society that
promotes running.

“A team like Chennai is
built around very slow wick-
ets,” Kirsten said. “It would
be interesting to watch how
they perform in different
conditions.”

Obvious favourites

He reckons Mumbai Indians
and Chennai Super Kings
are the obvious favourites.
“But I think it is going to be a

He said it was difficult to
predict how the tournament
would pan out.

“You might find that this
year’s IPL might have a new
winner. It would be fun to
have a winner other than
Mumbai or Chennai.”

Kirsten recalled that it
was a tough IPL for Royal
Challengers Bangalore last
year. “I have always had a
good relationship with (cap-
tain) Virat Kohli. Last year
we lost a lot of games initial-
ly but then were able to pull
it back.”

‘Shubman key to KKk’s campaign’

McCullum says Cummins will be a vital cog in bowling

Y.B. SARANGI
KOLKATA

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)
head coach Brendon McCul-
lum hopes the freshness of
pitches will suit his team’s
pace attack in the early stag-
es of the IPL.

Even in the changed sce-
nario with the tournament
being held in the UAE,
McCullum said the KKR pac-
ers could ‘shock’ opponents.

“I think the pitches are go-
ing to surprise a lot of people
early on in the tournament.
They're going to be quite
fresh. They could be quite
helpful for seam bowling, in
which case we've got Shivam
Mavi, Prasidh Krishna, Pat
Cummins, Ali Khan and
Lockie Ferguson.

“We've got a lot of quick
bowlers who bowl in excess
of 140kmph. We've also got
Andre Russell,” said McCul-
lum during an interaction.

 

Happy with spin options
McCullum was happy with
KKR’s spin options. “Later
on, spin will come to the
fore. We're fortunate with
our spin bowling lineup too.
We've got Sunil Narine, who
can bowl on any surface, Kul-

deep Yadav and Varun Chak-
ravarthy. And also we've got
this 20-year old (Manimaran)
Siddharth, who could sur-
prise a few people,” McCul-
lum said.

According to McCullum,
Pat Cummins will play a vital
role. “Cummins is the key
when it comes to overseas
bowlers. He has pace, expe-
rience and the ability to take
early wickets.”

Since Eoin Morgan’s pre-
sence provides strength to
the middle-order, Russell,
who hit 54 sixes last season,
could be used according to
the match situation. “His
game is definitely suited to

the last 10 overs where you
can really control it, but
there may be times where we
can send Andre a little bit up
the order.”

Short on experience
McCullum said KKR might be
short on experience but “the
talent, desire and the hunger
make up for the lack of
experience.”

He said he would provide
confidence to the squad and
work with the leaders. “One
of those guys who I think is
critical to this campaign is
Shubman Gill, because even
at such a young age I feel he’s
a leader,” said McCullum.

Dhoni more
popular than
Tendulkar:
Gavaskar

 

PRESS TRUST OF INDIA

 

ABU DHABI

The great Sunil Gavaskar
on Saturday said Mahendra
Singh Dhoni’s popularity
in India has exceeded the
level of fandom even the
great Sachin Tendulkar
and Virat Kohli enjoy in the
cricket-crazy nation.

Speaking about Dhoni
before the IPL opener, Ga-
vaskar said, “Since MSD
comes from Ranchi, which
doesn’t have a cricket cul-
ture as such, the whole In-
dia loves him. Tendulkar
has Mumbai and Kolkata,
Kohli has Delhi and Benga-
Juru but when you talk of
Dhoni it’s whole India.”

Staying in self isolation
for the first six days after
spending five months with
family was the hardest
phase, according to Dhoni,
who spoke for the first time
in months.

Warner looking to get
SRH off to a good start

Captain happy with the team’s balance

VV. SUBRAHMANYAM
HYDERABAD

Sunrisers Hyderabad cap-
tain David Warner wants his
team to hit the ground run-
ning in the IPL.

“Back-to-back wins is im-
portant. That is the way for-
ward,” Warner said at a vir-
tual media interaction from
Dubai on Saturday.

On Monday’s game
against Royal Challengers
Bangalore, the SRH captain
felt it was important to get
early momentum. “Every
team has a perfect mix of
world-class overseas players
and quality Indians. Ours is
a pretty well-balanced side
in all departments,” he said.

He had a message for the
team’s middle-order: back
yourself, play freely, and ifa
couple of wickets fall, put
the pressure back on the
bowlers.

 

Right attitude

Warner said that in the last
edition, the middle-order
did not get too many oppor-
tunities as the top three
scored heavily.

“Tt is good to have a lot of
youngsters in the middle-or-
der. They bring enthusiasm
and have the right attitude,”
Warner said.

On being captain again,

 

Warner. = FILE PHOTO: K.V.S. GIRI

Warner said it was a good
feeling, but for his team it
did not matter who was
leading.

“We have plenty of expe-
rience with the likes of Kane
(Williamson), (Jonny) Bair-
stow and Vijay Shankar, to
name a few. We got a job on
our hands for sure,” he said.

On opening with En-
gland’s Bairstow, Warner
said the two knew when to
take calculated risks and it
was time to do it again this
year.

The role of spinners
would depend on the pitch,
he added.

Despite the absence of
spectators, all teams would
be in a competitive frame of
mind once the tournament
gets going, Warner said.
